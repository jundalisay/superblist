Chapter 7 explained the nature of the living universe as the body of the Supreme Being, as being separate from that Supreme. 

This likewise led to the concept of Material Superphysics as the sub-aspect of Superphysics to study that body. From this, we can organize Superphysics relative to Science:


Parts of Existence | Paradigm | Modern Version 
--- | --- | ---
Absolute Entity (Pre-Existence) | Metaphysics | Philosophy
Supreme Entity | Superphysics | Religion
Physical Body of the Supreme | Material Superphysics | Science (with Physics as the core)


This living universe is the subject of study of Material Superphysics just as the Supreme Entity is the subject of Superphysics, and the Absolute Entity is the subject of Metaphysics.  


{{< q a="Descartes" c="Principles of Philosophy, Preface" >}}
All Philosophy is like a tree.
- Metaphysics is the root
- Physics the trunk
- All the other sciences are the branches that grow out of this trunk.

We gather fruit from the extremities of the branches of trees, not from the roots or the trunks.

Superphysics is the 'trunk' from which emerges 3 main sciences: 

1. Material Superphysics
2. Bio Superphysics
3. Social Superphysics


{{< q a="Descartes" c="Principles of Philosophy, Preface" >}}
There are 3 principal sciences:
1. Medicine
2. Mechanics
3. Ethics

<!-- The science of Morals is the highest and most perfect. Presupposing an entire knowledge of the other sciences, it is the last degree of wisdom. -->
