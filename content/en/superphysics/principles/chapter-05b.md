Chapter 4c explained the concept of Gravitational Signatures which represent the inherent true nature of an identity, as a particle, thing, person, place, etc.   

That signature is a purely metaphysical concept and has no direct physical manifestation. No one will be able to see or hear it. 

Its dynamics in the real world creates the idea of a gravitational territory which is the area where the gravitational signature can express itself and detect or interact with other signatures.

In human life, this territory is the aethereal aura that radiates from people.   

Some people radiate a strong aura which manifest as a strong personality or X-factor, just as a large star or galaxy has a large gravitational field or influence.

In Physics, a comet or asterod that enters a star's gravitational field will get a tendency to be attracted towards that star. 

Likewise, when we see or come close to a person, we might get a tendency to talk to that person if we feel a curiosity or common interest with that person.

Seeing or being that person is therefore being within that person's gravitational territory just as a body is attracted to a  bigger body that enters its gravitational field.

This is explained in detail in Material Superphysics.
