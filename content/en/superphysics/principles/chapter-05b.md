The 2 Forces interact with each other creating waves with 3 parts:

1. Crest
2. Origin, Rest, or Pause
3. Trough

When applied on the circular journey from pre-existence to existence and back to pre-existence, the 3 parts created by the 2 Forces manifest as 3 Influences:

1. Crudifying

This part crudifies the Supreme's metaphysical ideas in order to have physical existence.

2. Transformative 

This part part churns the created building blocks in order to create a diverse existence.

3. Subtlifying

This part makes the transformed substances more subtle in order to leave physical reality and enter metaphysical reality.  


{{< img src="/graphics/meta/gunas.png" alt="Gunas" cap="The 2 Forces create 3 influences based on their mutual interaction: Crudifying, Transforming, and Subtlifying. These are also the parts of a wave as the crest, middle part, and trough. These are known as the 3 gunas as Tamasic, Rajasic, and Sattvic. Each layer has these influences, creating 3 sublayers within a layer." >}}


These 3 influences is why each layer has 3 sublayers as:

1. Higher

Here, the Subtlifying Influence is stronger

2. Middle

Here, the Transforming Influence is stronger

3. Lower

Here, the Crudifying Influence is stronger


In Hinduism, these 3 influences are known as the 3 Gunas. 


{{< q a="Ramakrishna" >}}
Under the spell of God's maya, man forgets his true nature.

He forgets that he is heir to the infinite glories of his Father. This divine maya is made up of 3 gunas: 
1. Sattva
2. Rajas
3. Tamas
{{< /q >}}


These manifest most obviously in the Material Layer as the three colors of quarks.
