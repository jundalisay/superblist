Chapter 7 explained the nature of mind and of life, and how the physical universe is the living physical body of the Supreme Entity. 

Here, we explain the nature of the Absolute Entity which is the pre-existing or probabilistic version of the Supreme. 

<!-- We call such a Mind as the Supreme Entity, and The One where it comes from, as the Absolute Entity.  -->

    
Paradigm | Pre-Existence (Probability) | Existence (Matrix or Mind)
--- | --- | ---
Superphysics | Absolute Entity | Supreme Entity
Ancient Greek | The One | The Whole or The Other
Hindus | Nirguna Brahma | Saguna Brahma
Buddhists | Sunya | Brahma 
Taoism | Tao | tao 


Notice how our classification is existence-based, being divided into:

1. The Probability of Existence
2. Actual Existence 


This is very different from the Judeo-Christian God, Yahweh, Allah, and even the Polythesist Tara, Quan Yin, Kali, Ganesh, etc who are classified according to the feelings of the people who invented them:

- The Jewish Yahweh is very cruel. This mirrors the cruel environment experienced by the Jews during their journey through the desert
- The Christian God is very forgiving and generous. This mirrors the feelings of Jews under the wealthy Romans 
- The Islamic Allah is very commanding. This mirrors the feelings of Arabs rallying the tribes against the Byzantines and Persians.

<!-- This is because it is the feelings that propels the mind from idea to idea.  -->

To get a true view of the Supreme, we follow the 'critical feeling' techniques of Buddhism and Hinduism of catching and isolating our feelings so that we can see Existence in Its true form, without the bias of feeling.

This allows us to classify these descriptions of the Supreme according to whether they are more Positive or Negative.

Entity | Positive Force | Negative Force | Absolute (Neither Positive nor Negative)

## The Absolute Entity

We create the concept of the Absolute Entity in order to explain the nature of Probability of Existence. 

We can regard it as the Supreme Entity in passive or pre-existing form. 
<!-- It is the only entity that does not move is the entity that created the ideas, minds, and feelings in the Universe. -->
- The Ancient Greeks call it The One
- Hindus call it Nirguna Brahma
- Buddhists call it Sunya or Void

{{< q a="Aristotle" c="The Metaphysics by Aristotle Simplifed, Book 1, Part 8" >}}
The believers of The One [The Pythagoreans] say that The One is the cause of substance. 
{{< /q >}}


The Supreme Entity which is biased towards creation. This bias comes in the form of the Positive Force slightly dominating the Negative Force in the long run. 

The Positive keeps our universe in Existence whereas the Negative keeps that Existence dynamic. 

 <!-- which then leads to the constant existence and dynamism of our universe.      -->

The Absolute is beyond the Positive or Negative and consequently does not care or is not affected by them. It is the Supreme that 'cares' for Existence or Itself.
