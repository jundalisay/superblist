Previously, we dividided reality into 2 domans:

1. The Metaphysical
2. The Physical

The current sciences ignore the metapyhsical domain and instead focus solely on the physical one. Humans use philosophy, religion, and mysticism to explain metaphysical phenomena which are often disregarded as imaginary and its explanation as pseudo-science, as if science and the physical domain were superior.

We cure this paradigm problem or materialistic view by creating the a metaphysics-first perspective which we call the Cartesian View. This view takes the metaphysical domain as cause and the physical domain as effect.

Currently, science has only the 'Cartesian plane' which is used to plot movements on paper.

<!-- The movement of a country can be physical or aethereal. The left physical Cartesian plane for example can be made to represent the movement of a country from a population of 1 million to 4 million at year 4. The right aethereal Cartesian plane plots movement of the soul of the same society from tyranny or neoconservatism (tetrahedron) into aristocracy or conservatism (octahedron) based on the Socrates' social cycles. Alternately, the left plane can represent Covid infections from 1,000 to 4,000 at the Day 4. The right plane can plot the evolution of the variants that emerge. Lastly, the left plane can represent a ball at [1,1] rolling to [4,4]. The right plane will then plot the changes in the ball's changing gravitational signature at each point [1,1] [2,2] [3,3] [4,4], as three time intervals. This will then be useful for levitating the ball (forceless movement) -->
