We know the existence of thing through our perceptions of it. Each perception has 2 aspects:

1. Physical
2. Metaphysical

For example, when we see a mug, we have both the physical perception of a mug and a metaphysical idea of a mug nearly at the same time.

## The Two Domains

This means that the mug exists in 2 domains of reality:

1. The physical mug exists in the physical domain, which we can see and touch.

This mug is made of glass.

2. The metaphysical mug exists in the metaphysical domain, as our idea of what a mug is.

This mug-idea is made of aether.
    

Unlike the physical mug which we can see and touch, this aethereal mug-idea can only be perceived by our abstract minds.



## The Metaphysical Domain

This domain exists only because we have abstract minds which have an innate ability to "house" our ideas and thoughts.

We are able to conceive an idea, or think of a thought, if it bounces back from our minds onto our consciousness.

We are unable to have an idea if it does not bounce back to our consciousness.

An example of a metaphysical object that doesn’t bounce back is a thought that we forget, such as our password to an email account. 

We know that it was in our minds in the past. But our consciousness couldn’t ‘find’ it because it doesn't bounce back into our consciousness. It would be like querying a database without the query returning anything.

Another example is a problem that we have no solution for. We try to brainstorm for a solution until the it reflects onto our consciousness.

The metaphysical domain exists inside our abstract minds. It is infinitely larger and richer than physical domain of our senses.

We call this domain “aethereal” (made of aether) or akasha in Hinduism. This will be explained later when we explain our Five Layer Model.
