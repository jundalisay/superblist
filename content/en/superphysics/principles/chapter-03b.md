The previous section explained that the dynamism in existence is sourced from:
- the desire of the Creator to create things
- the rule that all created things must be unique  



## All Ideas are Static, All Movement Comes from Minds

<!-- Aethereal Relativity is concerned with the movement of ideas* as qoas (quantum of aether), such as how the idea of a horse-carriage moved and evolved into an automobile and then into an electric car, and then into a flying electric car in the future.   -->

A Creator is above, or superior to, its creations. 

Since Existence is only made up of ideas and feelings, then it follows that the Creator is above its ideas and feelings, even the idea of space and time. 

This means that all possible ideas have already been created (time is finished) and that the dynamism has already worn-off, since there is no more addition-action. To the Creator, all ideas have settled into perfection and are therefore static. 

However, this is opposite of our assertion that the Universe is dynamic, as we can plainly see. Even our ideas change, so how can ideas be static? 

This is because the staticity of ideas are from the viewpoint of the Absolute, before or after it takes the role of a Creator. This Absolute is in its own domain which we call 'Pre-Existence'.

As this domain is above Existence, it does not exist. Rather it is entirely probabilistic or theoretical. 

In applied Superphysics, especially in Material Superphysics, this is leads to the 'Probability Layer'.  

This Pre-Existence is a concept created to explain how Existence is generated arbitrarily or probabilistically by desire. This is why **the control of desire** is:
- one of the central tenets of Hinduism and Buddhism, and
- an important part of Islam which is imposed through fasting, charity, and modesty.  

Since ideas are static, it follows that it is the mind and its consciousness that moves from idea to idea in order to create compound ideas and experiences. This creates action and reaction, which are explained in the next chapter.



<!-- The Greeks of 500 BC got their ideas from the Hindus which had those ideas since 2000 BC. 

Timaeus got his four elements from the five elements of the Hindus, just as Socrates got his reincarnation and whorls from the reincarnation and chakras of the Hindus, just as Parmenides got his The One from Brahma idea. 

Even Stoicism from Zeno of 300 BC came from Buddhism of 500 BC. 

The difference is that those original ideas were in Sanskrit and not English. Rather the English version came from the Greek version which came from the Sanskrit version. But your mind is biased and so it stops at the Greek version and does not stretch to the original Indian version because that would mean that Indians were once intellectuallly superior to the warlike Europeans.

<!--  are static and non-moving, and it is the created minds that move from one idea to another. However, our perspective as humans is from the created minds. And so, for the purposes of explanation, we will take the opposite view and see our minds as stationary and ideas as moving. -->



<!-- Movement, Cause and Effect
The law of conservation of mass and energy is:

Matter and Energy cannot be created nor destroyed 


We extend this to the aethereal layer of ideas and feelings:

Ideas and Feelings cannot be created nor destroyed

<!-- even tribal humans have to evolve because gorillas will also evolve into the level of tribal humans and Law of Conservation of ideas. They will clash.   -->
