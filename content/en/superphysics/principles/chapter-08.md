Chapter 2 explained that we are inside the Mind of the Supreme Entity, as its thoughts in Existence. 

Therefore, our Universe which is a part of this Existence, is part of Its Mind.

The ancients classified the universe into five elements which we match to the four fundamental forces of Physics. 


Rank | Name | Greek-Hindu | Chinese | Physics Force 
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- 
0 | Probabilty | Potency | ? | Probabilty  
1 | Aethereal | Aether, Akasha | 水 (still water) | Pseudo-science  
2 | Spatial | Air, Vayu | 木 (moving wood) | Gravity  
3 | Radiant | Fire, Tejas | 火 (expanding fire) | Electromagnetism  
4 | Transformative | Water, Jala | 土 (changing earth) | Weak  
5 | Material | Earth, Pritvi | 金 (solid metal) | Strong

## Aether

This layer is best represented by the mind or soul. We can say that the universe is one huge aethereal mind, which the Hindus call Brahma. In our matrix analogy, this mind can be seen as the RAM of a computer that generates its own virtual reality.

Unlike Science and New Age philosophy that puts emphasis on consciousness as to put all existential mysteries in it, Superphysics puts all the mysteries in the aether which is the material or principles of the mind. This is because consciousness is just 'on' or 'off' just as existence either "exists" or "doesn't exist".  

The nature of this Mind then forms the subdivisions of Superphysics:

1. Material Superphysics - this studies the nature of the Mind of the physical universe
2. Bio Superphysics - this studies the nature of the Mind of a living being
3. Social Superphysics - this studies the nature of the Mind of society


## Spatial

This is the start of physicality by providing the physical arena for physicalized ideas as light, matter, objects, etc.

## Radiant

This is the Electromagnetic Force in Physics. It is where heat and light exists. In Cartesian Physics, this is the start of matter, which we do not adopt.  

Science already know a lot about this and the lower layers, so we do not need to add much. 


## Transformative

This is the Weak Force in Physics 


## Material

This is the Strong Force in Physics. In Newtonian Physics, this is the start of matter, which we adopt.
