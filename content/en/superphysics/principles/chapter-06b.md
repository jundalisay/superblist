Chapter 2 explained that the Creator of the universe created the universe from Its Own metaphysical ideas and feelings. This is similar to a novelist who writes a novel from a stream of ideas and feelings coming from his metaphysical mind. 

The purpose of ideas is to create experience. These experiences then create ideas. This leads to an unending loop of:
- idea-experience
- cause-effect
- action-reaction
- karma-samskara-karma
