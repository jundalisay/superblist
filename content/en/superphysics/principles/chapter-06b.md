Chapter 2 explained that the Creator of the universe created the universe from Its Own metaphysical ideas and feelings. This is similar to a novelist who writes a novel from a stream of ideas and feelings coming from his metaphysical mind. 

The purpose of ideas is to create experience. These experiences then create ideas. This leads to an unending loop of:
- idea-experience
- cause-effect
- action-reaction
- karma-samskara-karma

Action and Reaction applies not only in the physical domain, but also in the metaphysical.  

This is best observed as the action and reaction of our feelings.

- Bad or negative feelings lead to bad action 
- Bad actions lead to bad consequences
- Bad consequences lead to bad feelings

The cycle of negativity leads to the persistent suffering among physical beings. 

In our universe however, the Positive Force is slightly stronger than the Negative. This leads to the concept of morality as a check against negativity. 

Chapter 3 explaimed that true happiness is achieved when an identity matches or unites with its dharma or true nature. This match is facilitated by the Positive Force.  

Unhappiness is experienced when an identity is kept away from its dharma. This separation is done by the Negative.  

A moral or dharmic action is one that is in line with one's true nature or dharma. Its consequences are likewise Positive and within the dharma. 

As it is difficult to explain or even discover one's true nature, then we can shallowly define morality as a quality that produces happiness for now and for as long as possible, for the self and for as many entities as possible.

The phrases "for as long as possible" and "for as many entities as possible" shows an enlarged mentality that tries to unite with all of the universe. This is a sign of the Positive Force.
