Chapter 3 explained how the Law of Conservation of Idea gives every identity a unique dharma. This uniqueness gives it the property of movement and dynamism as it tries to preserve that uniqueness in the sea of creation. 

Chapter 4c explained the concept of gravitational signatures as notations of that dharma.

Chapter 5 explained how the Two Forces create attraction and repulsion between identities as examples of such movement. 

Chapter 5b explained the concept of Gravitational Territories. 

Combining these gives us 'The Elastic Theory' or the Theory of Elastic Gravitational Bands which is a consolidation of the theories from:
- Socrates, as the relativity of the motions in the heavens
- Kepler, as the links of kinship between planetary bodies
- Descartes, as the aether powering all movement

This theory explains the aethereal link that forms between two identites.  


It is applicable in many areas such as:
- Economics as price movements
- Sociology as international relations and cultural interaction
- Relationships as marriage and divorce 
- Physics as gravitation and magnetism
- Medicine as disease and wellness


<!-- which is the cause of all movement and change in the universe.

All of this movement is caused by the creation or existence of other ideas, which manifest as entities in the physical domain. The rule on uniqueness makes those entities move away from each other. This leads to our Theory of Dynamism.  -->
