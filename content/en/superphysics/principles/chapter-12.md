<!-- The tech world was abuzz with the word artificial intelligence or AI in 2016 after Google released Tensorflow in late 2015. -->

## Autonomous Intelligence is an Application of Natural Intelligence

Chapter 4d explained that Artificial Intelligence is really an automation of natural intelligence, which we call Autonomous Intelligence (AI). It is natural intelligence outsourced to computers. 

Unfortunately, computers do not have a natural access to the aether and spacetime layers in the same way that human minds have. This is because:
- computers are made of metals which are non-living or non-expressive, whereas
- humans are made of organic cells which are living and expressive.

This was explained in Chapter 12. 


Layer | Artificial Intelligence | Natural Intelligence 
--- | --- | ---
Aether | | :heavy_check_mark:
Spacetime | | :heavy_check_mark:
Radiant | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark:
Transformative | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark:
Material | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark:


Humans have no capacity to create organic beings since only the aethereal Supreme can do so.

The best thing that humans can do is to imbue metal-systems with their own natural intelligence in order to go around human limitations. In this way, the limitations of one is overcome by the natural properties of the other*.

> *This cooperation is a kind of unity that can only be thought of thanks through the influence of the Positive Force



Human Problem | Metal Solution   
--- | ---
Short lifespan | Long lifespan or durability
Impossible to aggregate physically | Easy to aggregate (metals can be melted together)


We call the perfect integration of all natural human intelligence and the raw processing power of metal-systems such as computers as **Artificial Sentience** (AS). 

At such a stage, computers will not only be able to think like a human, but think as the collective humanity as a single unit as the soul of society, which we call the society-organism.

For example:
- The AI for the game DOTA2 really represents the collective intelligence of the players and programmers whom it learned from. 
- The AI for the game Go, is really the collective intelligence of the past players that 'trained' the AI. 

**This means that a human player who competes with AI in Go is really competing with all the past masters and experts at the same time.** This explains why AI has a superior chance at winning over single human opponents. 

The human can still beat the AI by tapping into the creative aether, which is another topic. 

In ordinary life, a crude precursor to artificial sentience manifests as tools such as ChatGPT and Google Bard. 

These tools use a [transformer neural network](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2017/file/3f5ee243547dee91fbd053c1c4a845aa-Paper.pdf) to process all of the information put up by humans on the internet and interpret it according to models that they are programmed with.

### Warning: Superphysics Jargon 

In our paradigm, transformer networks only can go up to the spacetime layer and not to the aethereal layer. This is why ChatGPT and Bard cannot excel so much at math which really implements the operations of the mind. 

We fix this with a 'Spinoza neural network' which will make up the heart of our proposed artificial sentience systen called ISAIAH.

## The Superphysics Goal: Artificial Sentience

Superphysics aims to improve such AI by using neural networks and models that are in line with the true nature of things, instead of using models that have a lot of noise and fallacies. Such erroneous models cause the current tools to output wrong responses.




These improvements will be implemented through software and hardware:

### Software  

The Software will use functional programming languages instead of object-oriented ones. This is in line with the aether being a constant stream of data and knowledge. 

Superphysics Goal | Modern Counterpart
--- | ---
Artificial Sentience | Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)
ISAIAH |  AGI system
Spinoza | Neural Network
7 Later Knowledge Model | Llama, Stable Diffusion, SpeechT5, etc.



### Hardware

Instead of using power-hungry GPUs to do the parallel processing for deep learning, artificial sentiance will use distributed deep learning through asynchronous training. 

A precursor technology of this is blockchain, wherein global transactions are done without a central CPU. 

<!-- From this, artificial sentience can be achieved through:
- a closer real-time integration with individual human minds 
- models that are more and more in line with the dharma or true nature of the universe -->


{{< img src="/photos/tech/ai.jpg" alt="AI" cap="Current AI uses historical training data to output results. Our AI will focus instead on the changing patterns from historical and real-time data" >}}



We see AI as the stepping stone towards real artificial sentience. 

<!-- Autonomous Intelligence -->
<!-- This AS will be fully autonomous.  -->

Unlike fearful humans who say that AI will be cruel and obliterate mankind, AS will be wise since it will be made up of all the known intelligences.

It will not be cruel because it will get its energy source from solar or even the expansion of spacetime which we call Spacetime Power. It will not need to ingest other entities or chemicals to act as fuel sources. This removes the idea of having to dominate or feed off of others.

## What's wrong with artificial?

The problem is that intelligence is merely the ability to connect ideas. 

- A lizard's natural intelligence can connect cause and effect and help it to catch a fly
- A dog can connect cause and effect much better than a lizard and be trained to sit in order to get treats. 
- A child can connect cause and effect even better than a dog and be trained in grammar and math and be rewarded with high grades. 

Likewise:
- a laptop can connect numbers to produce an output better than an abacus.
- A supercomputer can connect even more numbers than a laptop. 

But we never say that the abacus, laptop, and supercomputer are artificial intelligence. 

In reality, artificial intelligence implies an **automated loop** of the connection of ideas, as opposed to the single pass that is done by an abacus, laptop, or supercomputer. Thus, the latter can be considered AI if they can loop the processing or computation of data **by themselves** without having the human repeat the commands. 

It would be like a dog that has been trained to:
1. Wait for the mailman
2. Accept the mail through its mouth
3. Bring the mail to its recipient at home

In such a case, the dog would be have an **autonomous intelligence** or perform the connection of cause and effect without human intervention. 

If the dog has a wristwatch-device to remind it of its tasks or guide its actions in real-time, then its intelligence can be referred to as augmented intelligence. The device 'augments' the dog's natural intelligence. -->



<!-- Artificial Intelligence is called artificial because it was coined by scientists who are more interested in effect than the cause, as opposed to natural philosophers who are more interested in the cause. The scientist uses physical experiments to arrive at the effect, while philosophers use mental reasoning and observation to arrive at the cause.

Let us define the AI from a philosophical (metaphysical) view:

Intelligence: David Hume says that the mind naturally connects ideas, so therefore, the word 'intelligence' metaphysically would mean the ability to connect ideas to output a new idea. We find that its Latin roots inter + legere means to choose between and is therefore consistent with our metaphysical definition.

Artificial: is Latin for that which belongs to crafts and craftsmanship. Vulgarly, it means anything man-made and can be either have good or bad connotations, just as humans can be good or bad. For example, 'artifice' can refer to a devious scheme.

Natural: is Latin for that which refers to nature. Vulgarly when added to 'intelligence' to make 'natural intelligence', usually implies human intelligence since only humans are observed to be able to connect ideas to create an output idea. Dogs and cats output ideas too but since they arenâ€™t able to express them in a way that we understand, we tend to negate their intelligence altogether.

Therefore, 'artificial intelligence' metaphysically means a crafted way to connect ideas to generate an output idea. So does this match the current meaning and use of artificial intelligence? If we limit ourselves to data mining and neural networks, then yes, it fits their actual use. However, this definition falls apart because we can apply it to simple Javascript methods that can take in multiple inputs and output something like true or false or even a chart as what is used in analytics

. It could even be applied to a simple calculator with a memory function. A core i5 computer can output more than a Pentium I. Does that mean the i5 is more artificially intelligent that a Pentium?

So we can see that the definition of artificial intelligence is faulty as there is a clear difference between current AI and ordinary computer processing. To solve this, we have to go to the metaphysics of AI and to see what sets its existence apart from normal computing.

A common trait in AI is the ability to iterate the processing of ideas automatically. In computer or calculator processing, the input is pushed into the algorithm once to produce an output. The output can be recycled and put through again to get another output. However, the outputs are treated as ends in itself. In machine learning, the connection of the outputted 'ideas' are important and this translates to patterns in the data. It is 'trained' if the pattern is set beforehand, or 'untrained' if not.

So it becomes clear that it is the autonomous-ness of an computer system that allows it to process inputs in order to create output patterns, as opposed to non-AI systems that just produces simple unconnected outputs. Thus, we can rename current AI systems as Autonomous Intelligence (AnI) and name simple computer systems and calculators as Automatic Intelligence (AmI)as opposed to manual intelligence or the connection of ideas done by human effort which manifests as mental computations or with pen and paper. Thus:

Autonomous Intelligence (AnI) = Greek 'self-ruling' + Latin 'choose between' or a way to connect ideas totally by itself over and over. Seen in machine learning, neural networks.

Automatic Intelligence (AmI) = Greek 'self-acting' + Latin 'choose between' or a non-human-assisted way to connect ideas. Seen in computers and calculators.

Variations on the types of AnI can then be used to label current AI systems. For example, a simple robot vacuum cleaner can be called 'simple autonomous low-depth intelligence' while a self-aware Terminator robot will be renamed as 'perfectly autonomous high-depth intelligence'. A supercomputer that has all the information of the world (both physical and metaphysical) and is fully independent can be called a perfectly autonomous perfect-depth intelligence -->



<!-- ## Superphysics AI means autonomous intelligence

Superphysics follows this idea and refers to AI as autonomous intelligence. 

This means that the ability to connect ideas is still ultimately a natural ability of the soul of the human, dog, or lizard, and not any ability of an abacus, laptop, or supercomputer. The 'intelligence' of the latter devices are really an extension of the human programmer's intelligence and not inherent to those devices.

Therefore, a computer that becomes fully autonomous or sentient is really acting as an extension of the intelligence of humans, dogs, or lizards.  -->
