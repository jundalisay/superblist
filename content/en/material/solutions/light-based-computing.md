Light, as analog waves, carry more data as "R-O-Y-G-B-I-V" than electrons that can only carry digital binary data as "ON-OFF" at a time. This analog light data can then be absorbed by glass or semiconductor crystals](https://www.pcgamer.com/microsofts-light-based-computer-marks-the-unravelling-of-moores-law/) to be processed by normal computer logic. 

This principle was recently proven to be realizable [in Germany](http://www.fv-berlin.de). In their experiment, intense light pulses of waves ranging from near-infrared to visible orange were used to generate oscillating currents in a chip made with *gallium arsenide*. The chip then emitted terahertz radiation from the oscillations. 

This tapping onto the dynamic wave-nature of light is a marked advancement over the use of lasers which are of a fixed or single wavelength. Examples of the latter technologies are:

- [the space laser satellites planned by Facebook](https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/aerospace/satellites/facebooks-secret-space-lasers). 
- [using lasers in silicon chips](https://spectrum.ieee.org/lasers-on-silicon)

Examples or precusors of dynamic wavelength technologies are: 

- [the use of short bursts of light to store more data](https://phys.org/news/2019-01-photonic-memory-devices-light-written-ultrafast.html)
- [the use of light-based in-memory processors by IBM](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ibm-is-using-light-instead-of-electricity-to-create-ultra-fast-computing/) using different optical wavelengths for each calculation

## Why Light-based Computing is Important to Superphysics

The lofty goals and solutions of Superphysics are best achieved through the use of machine learing and [automated intelligence](/superphysics/principles/chapter-12/) which will manifest as [ISAIAH](/superphysics/principles/chapter-04d/):


Branch | Goal | ISAIAH Feature
--- | --- | --- 
Material Superphysics | Levitation of objects | Navigate
Bio Superphysics | Prediction of Disease Risk | Doctor
Social Superphysics | Supply and Demand | Match


Electricity-based computing is too slow to process the data needed to output results. Light travels faster and this will translate to faster results for our proposed machine learning system.
