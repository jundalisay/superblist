According to General Relativity, the orbit of Mercury shifts or precesses because its closeness to the sun snags it into the sun's gravity well, causing its orbit to shift 43 arc-seconds. Instead of Newton's inverse square law which is indifferent to space, Einstein uses the inertia of the moving mass in reference to a flexible spacetime. These two things then causes the axis to precess. 

Under General Relativity , the precession of a planet can only be known by knowing the revolution "T", eccentricity "e", and orbit of a planet "a" beforehand, all requiring light or c. This means it has to wait for many observations before it can arrive at an answer.

In our quest to break free from the shackles of light and the arbitrary spacetimes enabled by by Einstein, we introduce the Theory of Gravitational Relativity based on Kepler's ratios. Unlike Relativity which sources movement from an external spacetime, Gravitational Relativity sources movement from the internal core of objects, whether they be planets, galaxies, or ballpens. 

It explains that Mercury's precession is caused by its core being 75% of its mass. This is different from the core of Earth and Venus which are 30% of its mass, and Mars which is 25%. This gives it the dynamics of a comet instead of a planet. This is supported by asteroid PH27 which has a bigger precession than Mercury. 

With Mercury solved, we will next apply Gravitational Relativity to solve gravitational lensing (core of light) and gravitational waves (core of stars) without needing arbitrary Gaussian coordinates or the metric tensor.


For decades, scientists believed that collisions with other bodies during the formation of our solar system blew away much of Mercury's rocky mantle, leaving a dense, metal core.

<!-- McDonough's new model shows that during the early formation of our solar system, when the young sun was surrounded by a swirling cloud of dust and gas, grains of iron were drawn toward the center by the sun's magnetic field. When the planets began to form from clumps of that dust and gas, planets closer to the sun incorporated more iron into their cores than those farther away.

The researchers found that the density and proportion of iron in a rocky planet's core correlates with the strength of the magnetic field around the sun during planetary formation. Their new study suggests that magnetism should be factored into future attempts to describe the composition of rocky planets, including those outside our solar system.

The composition of a planet's core is important for its potential to support life. On Earth, for instance, a molten iron core creates a magnetosphere that protects the planet from cancer-causing cosmic rays. The core also contains the majority of the planet's phosphorus, which is an important nutrient for sustaining carbon-based life.

Using existing models of planetary formation, McDonough determined the speed at which gas and dust was pulled into the center of our solar system during its formation. He factored in the magnetic field that would have been generated by the sun as it burst into being and calculated how that magnetic field would draw iron through the dust and gas cloud.

As the early solar system began to cool, dust and gas that were not drawn into the sun began to clump together. The clumps closer to the sun would have been exposed to a stronger magnetic field and thus would contain more iron than those farther away from the sun. As the clumps coalesced and cooled into spinning planets, gravitational forces drew the iron into their core.

When McDonough incorporated this model into calculations of planetary formation, it revealed a gradient in metal content and density that corresponds perfectly with what scientists know about the planets in our solar system. Mercury has a metallic core that makes up about three-quarters of its mass. The cores of Earth and Venus are only about one-third of their mass, and Mars, the outermost of the rocky planets, has a small core that is only about one-quarter of its mass.

This new understanding of the role magnetism plays in planetary formation creates a kink in the study of exoplanets, because there is currently no method to determine the magnetic properties of a star from Earth-based observations. Scientists infer the composition of an exoplanet based on the spectrum of light radiated from its sun. Different elements in a star emit radiation in different wavelengths, so measuring those wavelengths reveals what the star, and presumably the planets around it, are made of. -->
