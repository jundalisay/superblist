A muon is a subatomic particle that has a very short lifespan, only 2.2 microseconds on Earth.

Yet when it comes from outer space, it lasts longer and is able to hit the Earth. 

Einstein's Relativity explains that this is because the muon is travelling at nearly the speed of light. This causes space around it to 'contract' and its time to 'dilate'. This is why its 2.2 microsecond lifespan gets extended to give it time to reach the Earth. 

But to Descartes' Physics, this is a sophistry. Space only SEEMS to contract to those that are in a different position.   

To Descartes, the muon is a part of 'fire-aether', now called Electromagnetism by Physics. It comes from outerspace which is called 'air aether'. It then dies or vanishes to return as air-aether upon interacting with the atmosphere or 'water-aether' which is now called 'Weak interaction'*.


> *This is more obvious in Saturn which has a neutron exosphere. In Superphysics, the neutron is the representative particle or substance of the Weak Force, just as the proton is the representative particle in the Material Layer, instead of quarks.


{{< img src="/graphics/physics/muon.jpg" alt="Muon graphic" cap="To Einstein, speed is all-important. To Descartes, the nature of the object is all-important. Speed is just one of the effects of an object's nature, in relation to other objects and natures.

The muon lasts longer because it travels in the atmosphere which has both air-aether (spacetime) and some water-aether in the form of neutrons. 


<!--    -->

The percentage of the air-aether declines as the muon approaches the Earth. It then vanishes when most of the area has water-aether instead. A neutrino that hits a neutron turn both into a proton and electron. 

<!-- It is the water-aether or weak force that facilitates the decay.  -->

Here, the speed of the muon is just one effect of its nature as fire-aether. Therefore, its speed is not important in explaining why its life got extended. 

Instead, the determining factor is the kind of aether that a particle is, in relation to the aether of another particle or environment. This is part of our Theory of Universal Relationality.


But in Relativity, speed is all-important, and not the nature of the object.

It merely says that time dilates and space contracts for something the faster that thing is travelling relative to the speed of light. But then it decrees that masses cannot travel as fast as light because it would need an absurd amount of energy.  

Relativity is complicated and full of inconsistencies. 

Cartesian Physics is simple and intuitive. It can be applied to fix Newtonian errors:

- The precession of Mercury is caused by the solidity of its core in relation to the core of the Sun.
- Gravitational lensing is caused by the refraction of light by the air-aether of stars. Dark matter is unnecessary.
- Galaxy rotation is caused by the vortex of the air-aether of a galaxy's supermassive black hole.
- There was never a singular Big Bang, and distant galaxies are not older. They are merely more distant.
- The longer telomeres in outer space is caused by the freedom from the earth aether. 

With these, we can safely remove Einstein's Relativity since everything from Classical to Quantum mechanics, from the quantum scale to the macro scale, is neatly and intuitively explained by Cartesian Physics.

Instead, we replace it with the original Relativity of Lorentz which introduced the concept of space contraction. 

The difference is that its concepts only apply to the perspective of electromagnetism, and not to physical matter (earth aether or strong force).

It is useful in deriving the characteristics of the air-aether (directly) and the pure aether (indirectly).
