Material Superphysics is largely based on Descartes Principia Philosophia which rivals the work of Newton. For example:
- *La Dioptrique* is the counterpart of Newton's Principia
- *Traité du monde* is the counterpart of Newton's System of the World. 

In addition, Descartes describes the phenomena observed by current Physics:


## Quantum Mechanics

In Meditations, Descartes correctly says that reality is not real. In Traité du monde, he explains that the aether travels instantly. We combine these to make a roadmap for teleportation tech and make masses travel faster than light (which is impossible to Newton or Einstein).


## Relativity

Relativity is baked into Descartes Third Rule of Motion. Newton does not have relativity in his laws because he assumed a static material universe.    


## Gravity

Unlike Newton who professed that he did not know the origin of gravity, Descartes explains it as coming from spacetime particles which he called the aethereal air, which we call qosts.

Descartes' gravity is consistent with Kepler's gravity as invisible chains or slings. Superphysics calls it *bands* so that `w = mg` becomes `w = mb`, or `E :: Gb` in qualimath.

Instead of focusing on mass, the focus is on the elasticity of the band which has relativity baked in. This negates any need for Einstein. This will allow things to travel faster than `c` again, as intended by Nature. 

We can say that The Elastic Theory is the liberation of Physics from the dark ages of Einstein.


## Electromagnetism

Descartes' was one of the first to draw a magentic field. His focus was light and not electricity because light is the subtler part of electromagnetism (in the upper layer). Electricity is the cruder part (in the lower layer). 

This is why we advcoate light-based computing over electron-based computing.

## Black Holes

Descartes called them air-aether which spin as vortices. He explained how the vortices create light, and how lensing works through them.

The swirl of a Cartesian vortex (black hole) was recently proven by Sagitarrius A and Messier 87. To Cartesian physics, a Newtonian singularity that violates physics is absurd and not needed because vortices already work fine.
