Einstein's Relativity only works from the viewpoint of electromagnetism.

Galilean Relativity and Newtonian gravity only works from the viewpoint of matter.

Superphysics uses all 5 Viewpoints:

1. Material (Strong Force)
2. Transformative (Weak Force)
3. Radiant (Electromagnetism)
4. Spatial (Spacetime) 
5. Aethereal


Einstein's Relativity works whenever electromagnetism is used as measurement.

Galilean Relativity works whenever the strong force is used as measurement as contact forces.

The principles of Galileo and Newton cannot work with the James Webb Telescope because it uses no contact forces.
