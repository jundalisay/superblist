Aethereal relationality deals with the movement between quanta of aether (qoas) as ideas, feelings, minds, and societies, based on the aethereal bands that tie them together. 

This relationality is the implementation of the harmonic ratios:

## The Flaw of External Motion

Newton described motion coming from an external force as a single movement. Einstein revised this by making it relative to frames of reference, as well as dividing it into smaller parts as tensors (as measuring rod `S`).

But where do all the external forces come from? 

Newton and Einstein source it from matter: The more matter, the more the gravitational force. This matter then came from a material Singularity that exploded as a Big Bang. 

But where did this Singularity come from?

## Internal Motion

To solve this mystery, we throw out sophistical opinion of Einstein, Newton, and Aristotle that movement is sourced externally whether from concentric spheres or a fabric-like spacetime. 

<!--  get out of this 
all separated by the simultaniety of time which he pegs to the speed of light which is really circular reasoning. 

The end result is a singularity that defies physics and which no one can explain. It's like hiding dust under the rug, hoping that no one will notice or ask about. -->

Instead, all movement is sourced internally, from the state-change of the object through its [gravitational signature](/material/principles/intro/chapter-02). For example, a man moves from the bed to the kitchen because his internal state changed. His mind switched from a `wanting-to-sleep-signature` to a `wanting-to-eat-signature`.  

A more technical example is how an app changes from one screen to another, such as a red screen changing into a blue one. This done by changing its `color-state-variable` from <code style="color: red">red</code> into <code style="color: blue">blue</code>. It gives an illusion of moving from a red screen onto a blue one when in fact the same screen is just redrawn to reflect the change in state. 

**This means that the universe re-drew itself while the man was traveling from the bed to the kitchen.** This then matches the probabilistic nature of particle spin.
