The Quantum of Aether or Qoa is the basic unit or substance in the aethereal layer. It manifests as idea.  

In ancient natural philosophy, the aether was called the 'substance' that filled all of Existence. 

Since it is two layers above the radiant layer which facilitates sight and touch, then it is not visible nor tangible.

It is detected in 2 ways:

1. Directly through intution

Intuitional detection of the aether is explained by Bio Superphysics. 

2. Indirectly through patterns from the visible layers 

This will be done in Material Superphysics through Qualimath. 



{{< q a="Descartes" c="The World Simplified" >}}
Every substance has one principal attribute.
- Mind-substances have thinking as their one principal attribute.
- Body-substances have extension as their one principal attribute.

Thus:
- extension in length, width, and depth, constitutes the nature of corporeal substance.
- thought is the nature of thinking substance
{{< /q >}}



Everyone has had an idea. Therefore, ideas are real, but not physical in nature. These ideas then spur us into action in the physical domain.

From the Creator's viewpoint a qoa is Its idea. From a createe's viewpoint, it is a thought. 


## The Aether is the Medium of Sound

The Aether is the medium of sound just as space is the medium of light. 

This is why ideas are best expressed by speaking them instead of writing or acting them out.

THe lower layers are manipulated by sound, as will be explained in our chapter on Harmonic Ratios. 


<!-- The heart of Descartes' model of the universe is the invisible aether that permeates all of space. 

This aether dictates mass, creates round shapes, elliptical orbits, and the spiral motion of galaxies. In Hinduism it is known as akasha and is beyond or 'behind' spacetime. In Physics, it takes the form of the Higgs Field which has the same properties. 

Since it exists behind spacetime, the normal Cartesian or Galilean coordinates won't work. Instead, we create an aethereal Cartesian plane that has only one space and continuous time. This follows the characteristics of waves which continue forever and regardless of space.

This visualization tool can then reveal the five main Platonic solids that make up the universe, a concept that the Greeks learned from the ancient Egyptians.
