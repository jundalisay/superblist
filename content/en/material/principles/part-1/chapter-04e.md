{{< q a="Kybalion" >}}
This says that all manifested things have 2 sides, 2 aspects, 2 poles, a pair of opposites with manifold degrees between the 2 extremes.
{{< /q >}}


The constant action by the Positive and Negative Force on Substance which we call Quantum create a polarity on each substance or quantum, which then manifests as a particle or a wave. 

We say that each quantum exists with a set charge or predisposition from the very beginning. This polarity is called differently in each Layer.

Layer | Physics Polarity Name | Superphysics Name | Effect
--- | --- | --- | ---
Probability | ? | Existing or Non-Existing | Exist or Not Exist
Aethereal | ? | Positive or Negative Disposition |  Attract or Repel
Spatial | ? | Clockwise or Anticlockwise Rotation | Materialize or Dematerialize
Radiant | Positive or Negative Charge | Male or Female Charge | Attract or Repel
Transformative | Left Hand or Right Hand Chirality | Clockwise or Anticlockwise Rotation | Transform or Not Transform
Material | Left Hand or Right Hand Chirality | Clockwise or Anticlockwise Rotation | Materialize or Dematerialize
