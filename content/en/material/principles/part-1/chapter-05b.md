In "The Quantum Theory of Line-Spectra", Niels Bohr explains the mechanics of quantum theory that can work without Einstein's Special Relativity.

The problem began when Einstein explained quantum mechanics based on his quack principles of Relativity which is ultimately based on Boltzmann's energy (entropy). 

Bohr offers an alternative theory that is based instead of the aether, citing the aether-electron theory of Larmor and Lorentz. 

He applies this to the Zeeman effect wherein light is affected by magnetism as to cause perturbations in the light. 

Relativity says that the perturbations are caused by the relativity of the speed of electrons and the speed of light. 

Bohr, however, says that Relativity is wrong because it does not account for all the effects. Instead, Bohr points to the aether and how it can cause changes to the angular momentum of light via magnetism as to explain the perturbations. 

Instead of the Relativity of speeds and reference frames, Bohr's mechanism is state-change and angular momentum by the aether. 

This is exactly the mechanism of Descartes' Physics, wherein state-change and angular momentum or spin makes up his 1st and 3rd rule of movement respectively. 

In contrast, Newton never regarded spin or angular momentum as a fundamental law of motion, making Newton's Laws perpetually deficient in  explaining all movement in the universe. 

Gaps in Newton are then filled up by Einstein's quackery.  

Under Relativity, a thing can be made to levitate or teleport if a lot of energy is used. 

But in Cartesian Physics, only the proper aether configuration is needed. 

We define the aether as the material of ideas, feelings, and the mind that has those ideas and feelings. In the West, Pythagoras was the first to systematize the understanding of the aether after importing the knowledge from Egypt. 

This is why he invented music theory as "do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti-do", to signify 7 energy states, since music directly manipulates the aether. This matches the 7 colors in the spectrum as R-O-Y-G-B-I-V.

We experience this when we are sad and get uplifted by happy music. Thus, music can lead to a state-change in the aethereal mind.  

This is why Socrates said that the Pythagoreans often stuck their ears onto things to discover the aether configuration in that thing. But he says that that was the wrong technique to begin with. 

Bohr seems to understand the aether effects on electromagnetism, as quantum mechanics. But he does not seem to discover how to manipulate the aether. 

In fact, only 3 human civilizations have exhibited proof of the knowledge of how to tap the aether: The ancient Egyptians, Hindus, and Chinese. 

The Egyptians show this in their pyramid construction. The Hindus and Chinese show this as levitating monks.

The proper understanding of how to manipulate the aether will lead to spacetime technology. Such a technology can "float" mining equipment to the moon to mine precious metals there. 

These can then be floated back to earth to create better iPhones, Teslas, computers, etc. more cheaply while bringing and end to the mining on Earth that destroys essential wildlife. 

It can float plasma and reduce energy requirements in order to realize fusion just like in stars which "float" in outerspace. 

After things are floated via the aether, then humans can safely delete Einstein and Relativity from Physics as a long-running 100+ year scam that began in 1905 and has made science and technology impotent for so long.
