Superphysics uses the Eagle equation to connect all movements, as ratios between gravitational signatures. We call the operation of these ratios as the **Kepler Tensor**.  

These ratios determine attraction, repulsion, or stasis or stability of the objects or identities concerned. 

The harmonic ratios of Kepler came from the musical notes invented by Pythagoras.


## The Origin of the Musical Notes

In 535 BC, Pythagoras went to Egypt to learn Egyptian Science and Cosmology. He came back with the scale `do re mi fa sol la ti`.

Note | Representation
--- | ---
Do | Gamma or Gaia or Earth-Element which is the 1st Element now called the Strong Force
Re | Things (Latin 'Re')
Mi | Moons (Greek Minis)
Fa | Planets (Egytian 'bearer'). This has the 2nd Element as Water or Weak Force.
Sol | Stars (Greek 'Sun'). This has the 3rd Element as Fire or Electromagnetism.
La | Galaxies (Latin 'Lac' or Milky [way]). This has the 4th Element as Air or Spacetime.
Ti | The total perception (Latin 'Ti' or you). This has the 5th Element as Aether.

Johannes Kepler revived the Pythagorean system to explain the gravitation between planets and the sun as Harmonic Ratios. 

Instead of using equations such as Force = Mass * Acceleration, Kepler's system uses ratios. For example, a starting ratio for a mass is:

```
Mass_State1 : Location 1
```

To move it to location 2:

```
(Material Contact Force + Mass_State1) : Location 2
```

Here, matter-ial forces can be added to matter to change their location in space because both are of the Earth-Element (Strong Force). 

In effect, the addition of the Material force on Mass_State1 caused it to change state, so that:

```
Mass_State2 : Location 2
```

But this is not true for Electromagnetic Forces (Fire Element). For example, the following does not work:

```
(Heat + Mass) : Location 2
```

Instead, to move the mass to location 2 Physics uses `(F = Q(vB))`:

```
Magnetic Force + (charged object (magnetic speed : field)) : Location 2
```

Note how this has more factors than matter-induced movement. Those factors have to be manipulated in a more precise way to change the state of the mass or object. 

Therefore, to move the mass with Aethereal Force (5th Element):

```
Aethereal Effort + (mass (...) : (charged object (..)) : Location 2
```

Where `...` represents the factors that we are still trying to discover.

This is the foundation of anti-gravity as done by the ancient Egyptians.



Kepler's system was very complicated, because being German like Hegel and Kant, he over-explained it as to be totally confusing.

Newton solved it with a dumbed-down system of F = ma. It removes the factors and makes it understandable to all. 

But by doing so, it also removed the possibility of magenetic and aethereal movement.

We aim to simplify Kepler's system to make it understandable while retaining its potential for aethereal movement, as well as more improved magnetic ones.
