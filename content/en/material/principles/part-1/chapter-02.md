In the metaphysical domain exists the aetheral layer, which we divide into 3 sublayers:


Sublayer | Example
--- | ---
Upper | The soul of a dog-identity, the soul of a society-identity 
Mid | The idea of a shoe, the feeling of hunger, the personality of the dog or society 
Lower | The thought of a shoe, the emotion of need

<!-- 1. Physical: Your physical shoes, breakfast, dog, and country go here
2. Aethereal:  go here  -->

We plot their movements in two Cartesian planes:

1. Aethereal Cartesian Plane: This will be used in visualizations of aethereal movement and quantum mechanics (probabilities) 
2. Physical Cartesian Plane: This is already used in algebra and calculus for the movement of matter

The Cartesian View also has 3 attributes:

Attribute | Description
--- | ---
**Plane** | The physical plane is determined, the aethereal is non-determined
**Layer** | The physical plane has 5 layers, the aethereal has more than 5
**Timespan** | The physical plane has a timespan set from outside the plane, the aethereal sets the time from the inside, at the center (the present)

### Data and Visualizations First, Equations Later

Isaac Newton started with astronomical data which he then visualized as curves and parallelograms. From there, he used algebra and analytic geometry to create equations that led to his Calculus.

Richard Feynman did the same thing by drawing diagrams depicting the outcome of particle interaction. From there, equations were created.

The aethereal Cartesian plane follows the same pattern by visualizing the data directly. From there the equations can be derived in order to predict or change the movement of the identity in question.

## Force Versus Effort

These two planes then separate the two causes of motion:
- External Physical Force (`F`)
- Internal Aethereal Effort (`E`)

We can say that `F` is Newtonian, while `E` is Asian. For example:
- the Force `F` needed to push a box 10 meters might be 10 Newton
  - `F` depends on the gravitational signature of the box and that of the Earth
- the effort needed to move a permit application to the next step in a government bureaucracy `A` might be 5 Effort, but only 3 Effort in government `B`
  - `E` depends on the gravitational signature of the permit (its contents and nature) and that of the government officer

Of course, we can push the box without deriving the gravitational signature of the box, since its weight already signifies it. Thus, in this case, we have no need for the aethereal Cartesian plane.

Likewise, a physical Cartesian plane might not be so useful in helping us get permits rushed in governments. But a real-time visualization of the aethereal Cartesian plane of two governments will help us figure out which one to approach and when, since it squeezes in more information. 

Both can be visualized in the physical and aethereal Cartesian planes. This is actually how we plot the [Effort Theory of Value](/social/economics/principles/part-2/chapter-01b/) in Supereconomics.

### How the Cartesian View Applies in Daily Life

We can apply the two views in the organization of information, such as blog posts. For example, posts on the topic of Covid-19 will likely have the following format, following the physical view based on time:

    - January 2020: Title: Novel Coronavirus cases gain
    - April 2020 Covid-19 spreads globally
    - February 2021 Delta variant spreads in India
    - November 2022 Omicron Variant discovered

An aethereal view will have follow a different format according to topic instead of time: 

    - Covid-19
      - January 2020: Novel Coronavirus cases gain
      - April 2020: April 2020 Covid-19 spreads globally
    - Delta Variant:
      - February 2021 Delta variant spreads in India
    - Omicron Variant:
      - November 2022 Omicron Variant discovered

The time-based physical view is what most news reports and blog posts use. The topic-based aethereal view is followed by encyclopedias such as Wikipedia. The topic-based view is constantly edited to match the current understanding, whereas the time-based view is always based on the past.

We can say that the physical view is effortless, just like a computer logs down events automatically without interpretation. The topic-based view, on the other hand, is effort-driven as it needs some mind to arrange the information from the perspective of the past according to the perspective of the present.
