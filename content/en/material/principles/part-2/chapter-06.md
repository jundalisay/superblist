Spacetime technologies are those that use the Spacetime Layer as its main mechanism. That mechanism uses invisible spacetime particles caled Qosts or Quanta of Space-Time.

The practical use of qosts is to enable levitation and teleportation technologies that do not rely on lower layers such as the Radiant layer as electromagnetism (EM) or the Materal Layer as material combustion. This will lead to cheaper and faster spacetravel that is impossible with the current combustion-based technology as used by SpaceX and the Atlas rocket.

 <!-- which is based on the material and transformative layers. -->

In addition, the perpetual creation or division of qosts leads to their mutual repulsion which can be tapped as a source of reliable energy. The proper control of qosts* will help make [nuclear fusion controllable](/material/principles/part-2/chapter-02).

> *The qosts are subordinate to the aethereal layer and so they can be controlled from that layer.

### Is Spacetime Technology Even Possible?

The disbelief of some people on such future technologies is similar to a caveman's disbelief that it would be possible for a human to see and talk to another human on the other side of the world.

Such disbelief comes from the caveman's ignorance of electromagnetism, just as the modern human ignorance of gravitation and spacetime leads to their disbelief of levitation, teleportation, and spacetime energy sources.

Our proofs for such future technologies is evidenced by 4 artificial phenomena:

<!-- These use the same principle as two galaxies which naturally increase the distance between each other: -->

1. The abilities of UFOs to zip by and teleport nearly-instantly to other galaxies
2. The ability of Buddhist monks to levitate without any external energy source
3. The Egyptians lifting huge pyramid blocks without cranes*
4. The Israelites making the walls of Jericho collapse (increase their gravity) via trumpets, without using any combustion or electric technology 

> *There is a misconception that the Egyptians levitated the blocks in place. Based on our Elastic Theory of Gravity, this is highly unlikely. What the Egyptians did was to use anti-gravitation to make the blocks lighter, as to be easier to lift onto boats or onto their spots in the pyramid.


Two of these phenomena have been recorded on video:

The common reaction of disbelievers is to reject such evidence. But without such evidence, then there is no hope of ever developing such technologies that those very disbelievers would benefit from (just as everyone now benefits from electric power).

It would be like cavemen preferring that all humans stay as cavemen instead of upgrading themselves into modern humans who enjoy modern conveniences like the internet, healthcare, and manufacturing. This would happen if such caveman preferred easy skills such as hunting, gathering, and idol worship over advanced skills acquired many years from from preschool to university. 

The skillset for qost and aetherial technologies require much more education than what is currently available -- it would require everyone to learn both Western and Eastern philosophy (subjective aspects of reality), on top of data science and all the fields of maths (objective aspects).
