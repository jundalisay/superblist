## The Unity of Space and Time is the Unity of Subject and Object

In the previous chapter, we defined:
- "space" as the gap between the perceiver and existence.
- "distance" as the gap between two perceived identities, as objects, places, events, etc. 

Here, we define:
- "time" as the gap between one experience and the experience of existence in general
- "timespan" as the gap between specific experiences or events

Unlike the other layers, the spatial layer is about the gap between:
- experiences, as the subject
- the objects in those experiences, as the object 

In the Physical Domain, space is dominant because objects are dominant. For example, an objects exists in 3 Dimensions of space as length, width, height, and 1 Dimension of Time. 

But in the Metaphysical Doman, time is dominant because subjects, as experiences, are dominant. For example, you can dream about different scenes without changing spaces. It would seem that a lot of time has elapsed per scene during the whole dream without any effort to spatially travel between scenes.

This is why we say time gets more malleable the higher the layer, while space becomes less important. 


 

## Physical Time and Metaphysical Time

Previously, we created the concept of Physical Space and Metaphysical Space. Here we likewise create the concept of Physical Time and Metaphysical Time. In Physics, this is similar to the concept of Proper and Coordinate Time from Einstein's Relativity.

Physical Time is objective, but Metaphysical Time is subjective. 

Physical Time in Superphysics also includes Newtonian Time and the Radioactive Decay-time of certain elements.

These 'times' follow the hierarchy of the 5 Layers. This means that:
- Metaphysical time is superior and the most important of all the times as it dictates our common actions
- Radiant or Electromagnetic time and Radioactive Time is important for precision measurements. 
- Material time is the most common time, as the one seen in clocks.  


Domain | Spacetime Sublayer | Name | Measure | Physics Name
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---   
Metaphysical | Aethereal | Mental Time | Experience | Coordinate Time (Einstein)
Physical | Radiant | Electromagnetic Time | Atomic Clock | Proper Time (Einstein)
Physical | Transformative | Radioactive Time | Radioactive Decay Clock |
Physical | Material | Material Time | Sand Clock | Absolute Time (Newton)

## Fixing Einstein's Spacetime

Current Physics has is stuck because Einstein 



Time, then, like space, is subjective and not a constant. It is dictated by the aethereal layer, just as the speed of light is dictated by spacetime or the spatial layer.

<!-- Relativity says that Proper Time passes faster on a mountain than at sea level because  -->

<!-- In Cartesian Physics, gravity is a force from the gravitational band between masses, stars, or galaxies.

The water spins because the energy is transferred to it by the bucket. There is a dip in the center because that is the center of gravity of the bucket, which serves as the anchor for the gravitational band between the water and the bucket and the Earth. 

In outer space, the bucket will be a torus and the water will form a donut shape since there is no band with the Earth.  -->

 <!-- because it covers more space for the same amount of Coordinate time, so Proper time adjusts accordingly. -->


<!-- Let's say 2 mountain-level proper-milliseconds pass for every 1 sea-level proper-millisecond. 

This is to compensate for the 1 coordinate millisecond taken by the perspective of man at sea-level who really bases both measurements from the center of the Earth. Proof is that the Hafele–Keating experiment showed difference between East and West travel.

If Proper Time were measured based on the Sun, then their Proper time would be the same: 12 noon sharp.

Einstein's Relativity only accounts for the gravity between:
- matter and matter, and
- light and stars/galaxies. 

It does not account for the gravity between:
- galaxies and stars (dark matter)
- galaxies and galaxies (dark energy).

Cartesian Physics does.

In Cartesian Physics, gravity is a force from the gravitational band between masses, stars, or galaxies.

<!-- Physicists are unable to find a [WIMP of dark energy](https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2019/02/22/the-wimp-miracle-is-dead-as-dark-matter-experiments-come-up-empty-again/#95053e86dbc6) because space isn't a thing that fills gaps between objects. Rather, it's just an effect of observation and is the same reason behind quantum non-locality.

Space-time depends totally on perception. Rather than say that it is infinite, it is more correct to call it as totally abitrary. A particle, when imposed on (since its 'spin' reflects reality), can therefore arbitrarily change its location and 'defy' gravity and locality.

This spin maniflests as:
- the rotation direction in the spatial layer
- the spin of particles in the radiant layer.

<!-- The cause of spacetime therefore is the cognition of this appearance of qosts which is caused by internal "aethereal"* factors. This is the opposite of Newton and Einstein who believed that movement is sourced from matter.

> *For example, your physical hand moves to grab a book because your athereal mind had an athereal feeling to grab it. Someone might tell you to grab the book, as to give the illusion that the source of the hand-movement was external from that person. But you can still refuse to grab the book due to your free will, and so the source of the resulting non-movement is still internal athereal feelings.

<!-- ## Replacing Einstein's "Time"

Einstein defined time as the time that it takes for light to travel between two events in spacetime. But this is circular reasoning since the speed of light also has a time component. Moreover, we defined spacetime as the effect of the qosts creating distance between each other, even before light existed. How can something non-existent define something that already exists?  


{{< q a="Einstein-sophist" c="Relativity Simplified, Section 8" >}}
We test simultaniety by putting an observer in the middle M between A and B. He as two mirrors inclined at 90° to let him see both A and B at the same time. If he sees the two flashes of lightning at the same time, then they are simultaneous.

You object by saying that they would only be true, that time would be simultaniety, if all light travels at a constant speed. <i><b>But the speed of light would itself be measured by time, so this is reasoning in a circle -- simultaniety has absolutely nothing to do with light.</b></i>

I answer that this simultaneity of time is only used for us to make empirical decisions.

<!-- Spacetime exists before, and independent of, light and electromagnetism. So how can something like light -- something that is unnecessary to spacetime -- be required to define spacetime? -->

<!-- Einstein's definition turns the effect as the cause which leads to make-your-own-spacetime such as De Sitter, Taub-Nut, and Godel, etc. If we exist in one universe, how can it have different spacetimes?

![E=mc2](/images/visible.jpg)

{{< cap >}}
E=mc^2 is true only if applied to visible objects. But no one seemed to notice it because everyone is likewise taking the perspective of the visible universe. The sophistry (half-truth, half-fallacy) of this equation is exposed by the fact that Einstein's field equations can't be solved and that wormholes have never been found.

<!-- > *The theoretical and arbitrary spacetimes are a consequence of General Relativity which uses light as a measure of everything. The problem with this is that light is an electromagnetic wave which manifests in a field, of which the nature is arbitrary just as each wavelength has its own properties. This leads to arbitrarily-invented spacetimes like De Sitter, Taub-Nut, Godel, etc. This is the same mechanism that causes human minds to create arbitrarily-invented concepts like God, Allah, Yahweh, Amaterasu, etc.  -->

Superphysics sources spatial movement internally from the center of gravity of discrete identities. Physics sources its movement from external forces or concepts, like the sophistical fabric of spacetime.

## Let's Get Moving!

These two make objects appear to move, depending on the rules of their layer and their relation to each other and to the observer. We can call this illusory movement in physical reality as 'relational physical movement' which we simplify as 'bands' and can be grouped into the five layers: -->

<!-- Since human bodies are in the material layer, then   -->

<!-- Name | Physics Name | Manifestation | Practical Goal
--- | --- | --- | ---
[Aethereal Bands](/material/principles/part-2/chapter-03) | Pseudo-science | Movement and transformation for qoas (ideas) between probabilities or multiverses inside minds | Bio Superphysics: know whether a person is moving towards disease so his course can be changed<br>Supersociology: know where the feeling of society is heading, so it doesn't go into anarchy<br>Economics: know whether the economy is moving towards poverty and inequality
[Spatial Bands](/material/principles/part-2/chapter-04b) | General Relativity | Movement of supermassive blackholes (qosts) as the expansion of the universe and galaxy rotation | [Allow fusion](/material/solutions/fusion) by levitating plasma, and allow teleportation to other galaxies
Radiant Bands | Special Relativity | Movement and transformation for photons (quanta of light or qol) and electrons (quanta of electromagnetism or qoe) | Make [light-based computing](/material/solutions/light-based-computing) more practical
Transformative Bands | Feynman Diagrams | Movement and transformation for neutrons | Allow alchemy 
[Material Bands](/material/principles/part-5/chapter-03) | Newton's Laws | Movement and transformation sourced externally | Enable teleportation and levitation technologies


When combined with each other, these are called **universal relativity**. External movement seems most obvious in the material layer. This manifests as a ball being moved by an external push, or a floating asteroid being moved by being hit by another asteroid. But on closer inspection, these are still sourced internally from their mass.  -->

<!-- Thus:

```universal relativity = aethereal relativity + gravitational relativity + radiant relativity + radioactive relativity + material relativity``` -->

<!-- The movement is caused by the observer -->

<!-- To totally control the movement of any object, such as a ball or an asteroid, you have to know its nature in the five layers to get its five relativities. Afterwards, it would be possible to make it zip, levitate, twirl, etc. Of course this would be nearly impossible since anyone who would know the nature of an object in the five layers would be omniscient, and an omniscient being would have more better things to do than to make a physical object zip, levitate, and twirl.

Humans are more limited but are able to know the principles of  -->




<!-- ## Let's put all human understanding together

From here, we can unify the ideas of the great physicists:

Physicist | Mistake | Cause of Mistake | Correction | Superphysics Score
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Kepler | The universe is confined to a fixed firmament | Limited observations | The universe is infinite (arbitrary) | 8/10
Descartes | Gravity is caused by the aether which creates spinning vortices | Imposing the aethereal layer directly onto the physical layer | The aether is in a separate layer that affects the physical layer indirectly. This leads to the spinning of galaxies and orbital movements | 7/10
Newton | Gravity comes from mass | No observations of galactic movements | Mass comes from gravity, gravity comes from the aether | 5/10
Einstein | Gravity comes from mass through the distortions of the spacetime fabric or field | Using light as the measuring rod | Use sound as the measuring rod, in line with Kepler and Pythagoras | 3/10

As you can see, aethereal bands are far more important than spatial bands and that is why we are focusing on it more. As such, we will explain it next by explaining the aethereal layer.
