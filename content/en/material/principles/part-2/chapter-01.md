<!-- According to Physics, gravity comes from mass which then comes from the Higgs Field. This leads to a matter-based singularity that exploded as a Big Bang that created the universe. 

Because of this, physicists imagine that the insides of matter hold the secrets to the universe. This is why they keep on smashing subatomic particles, like a treasure-hunter digging the ground uselessly looking for hidden gold. 

But Nature says otherwise, that the matter is the effect and not the cause of Creation. Digging into effects will lead to more effects and not the cause. 

The reason for the physicists' confusion is that energy and mass are so tied together, like two sides of a coin. It makes them think that the effect is the cause. This traps them in the effect, making the cause impossible to discover. This trap then prevents a whole new class of technologies that could have solved so many problems.

For example, physicists fail at fusion because they confine plasma with magnetism. This is despite the fact that the stars themselves show that their fusion is caused by gravity and not magnetism. So the solution is artificial gravity. The ancient Egyptians and Hindus already knew how artificial gravity works. But for some reason the East doesn't develop it and nor does the West don't tap into such knowledge.  -->





The spatial layer is below the aethereal, as the 'container' of a universe in an existence made up of a multiverse. 

It leads to spacetime and sets the speed of light, since it is superior to the the 3 lower Layers of:
- Electromagnetism
- Weak Force
- Strong Force

This layer gives the properties of size, space, timespan, and age of the universe and everything in it. 

## How It Works

The spacetime layer is the gateway that allows the ideas from the aethereal layer a chance to cross over onto physical reality via spacetime vortices, called black holes by Modern Physics, through galaxies and stars.

{{< img src="/graphics/physics/multiverse.png" alt="Multiverse with Universes" cap="Pre-existing aethereal ideas flow down into physical reality in a probabilsitic way. A single idea, when deployed, therefore has many versions in other universes of varying densities" >}}

Within one universe, the creation of these vortices leads to the mutual repulsion between them, leading to the perception of space and time.

<!-- In terms of creation, this is the second layer that processes ideas from the aethereal layer into possible energies and matter. -->


<!-- the mind or soul. We can say that the universe is one huge mind, which the Hindus call Brahma. In our matrix analogy, this mind can be seen as the RAM of a computer that generates its own virtual reality.

In Physics, this layer manifests as the Higgs Field. 

Descartes classifies this aether into two:
- The high energy aethereal fire: This matches the High energy Higgs Field, and roughly the Yin of Taoism 
- The low energy aethereal air: This matches the Low energy Higgs Field, and the Yang -->

<!-- A unit example is a human mind.  -->

## Space and Time

<!-- ## The Errors of Einstein Spacetime -->

The current concept of spacetime in Physics came from Einstein who believed that it is a fabric that warps wherever there is gravity. 

Superphysics spacetime is different in the sense that we define it as the material that splits perceptions into 2 components:

1. Space

This is the particle part or crudified part or physical part of the perception.  

2. Time

This is the wave part or subtle part or metaphysical part of the perception.

Current Physics sees spacetime as 3 dimensions as spatial length, width, height and 1 dimension of time. This arises from a matter-first perspective. This is because a material thing, like a rock, has length, width, height. Its rolling movement from location A to location B then takes time. 

In contrast, our spacetime is seen from the aether-first perspective, as a result of perception or observation.

The rock's length, width, and height and time to roll, all come from our aethereal mind's decision to perceive the rock' spacetime aspects. In other words, the spacetime of the rock existed because our aethereal mind wanted to experience it.  

Unlike the Einstein's spacetime which is rigid and measured by the speed of light, the Superphysics spacetime is malleable. In fact, there are 4 measures for our spacetime:

Metaphysical | Aethereal | Mental Time | Experience | Coordinate Time (Einstein)
Physical | Radiant | Electromagnetic Time | Atomic Clock | Proper Time (Einstein)

Physical | Material | Material Time | Sand Clock | Absolute Time (Newton)
