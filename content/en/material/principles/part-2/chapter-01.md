The spatial layer is below the aethereal, as the 'container' of a universe in an existence made up of a multiverse. It leads to spacetime and sets the speed of light, since it is superior to the the 3 lower Layers of Electromagnetism, Weak Force, and Strong Force.

This layer gives the properties of size, space, timespan, and age of the universe and everything in it. 

## How It Works

The spacetime layer is the gateway that allows the ideas from the aethereal layer a chance to cross over onto physical reality via spacetime vortices, called black holes by Modern Physics, through galaxies and stars.

{{< img src="/graphics/physics/multiverse.png" alt="The 5 Layers" cap="Pre-existing aethereal ideas flow down into physical reality in a probabilsitic way. A single idea, when deployed, therefore has many versions in other universes of varying densities" >}}

Within one unvierse, the creation of these vortices leads to the mutual repulsion between them, leading to the perception of space and time.

<!-- In terms of creation, this is the second layer that processes ideas from the aethereal layer into possible energies and matter. -->

In Physics, this layer manifests as the Higgs Field. 

Descartes classifies this aether into two:
- The high energy aethereal fire: This matches the High energy Higgs Field, and roughly the Yin of Taoism 
- The low energy aethereal air: This matches the Low energy Higgs Field, and the Yang -->

## Space and Time

<!-- ## The Errors of Einstein Spacetime -->

The current concept of spacetime in Physics came from Einstein who believed that it is a fabric that warps wherever there is gravity. 

Superphysics spacetime is different in the sense that we define it as the material that splits perceptions into 2 components:

1. Space

This is the particle part or crudified part or physical part of the perception.  

2. Time

This is the wave part or subtle part or metaphysical part of the perception.

Current Physics sees spacetime as 3 dimensions as spatial length, width, height and 1 dimension of time. This arises from a matter-first perspective. This is because a material thing, like a rock, has length, width, height. Its rolling movement from location A to location B then takes time. 

In contrast, our spacetime is seen from the aether-first perspective, as a result of perception or observation.

The rock's length, width, and height and time to roll, all come from our aethereal mind's decision to perceive the rock' spacetime aspects. In other words, the spacetime of the rock existed because our aethereal mind wanted to experience it.  

Unlike the Einstein's spacetime which is rigid and measured by the speed of light, the Superphysics spacetime is malleable. In fact, there are 4 measures for our spacetime:

Domain | Spacetime Sublayer | Name | Measure
--- | --- | --- | --- 
Metaphysical | Aethereal | Mental Time | Experience 
Physical | Radiant | Electromagnetic Time | Atomic Clock
Physical | Transformative | Radioactive Time | Radioactive Decay Clock
Physical | Material | Material Time | Sand Clock

<!-- Physicists are unable to find a [WIMP of dark energy](https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2019/02/22/the-wimp-miracle-is-dead-as-dark-matter-experiments-come-up-empty-again/#95053e86dbc6) because space isn't a thing that fills gaps between objects. Rather, it's just an effect of observation and is the same reason behind quantum non-locality.

Space-time depends totally on perception. Rather than say that it is infinite, it is more correct to call it as totally abitrary. A particle, when imposed on (since its 'spin' reflects reality), can therefore arbitrarily change its location and 'defy' gravity and locality.

This spin maniflests as:
- the rotation direction in the spatial layer
- the spin of particles in the radiant layer.
