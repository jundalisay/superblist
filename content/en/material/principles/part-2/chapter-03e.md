In the 1630's, Descartes described black holes as spinning spacetime vortices which prevented light from going into their center. These were opposed to stars which allowed light to go into the center.

The main reason for the difference is the sheer size of a galaxy's center compared to that of a star.

A stellar vortex is small, allowing the surrounding spacetime particles to easily compress and pressure the center. This pressure leads to a star.

But a galaxy's vortex is so huge that its circumference resembles a straight line. Since particles must travel straight, they go around the circumference instead of going towards the center like straight radii.

This makes the light stay outside of the vortex, different from a star where the light stays in the center. This outside light predicted by Descartes is now seen as the bright accretion disk of a supermassive black hole.

In Cartesian Physics, gravity is caused by spacetime vortices, not by matter. 

This removes the need for any dark matter to cause gravitational lensing. This is why dark matter has never been found and will never be found. 

This also gives Cartesian Physics the scope to create anti-gravity technologies by manipulating those vortices directly, something that was totally unknown to either Newton or Einstein.
