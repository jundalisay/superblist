A galaxy is the best representative body of the lower spatial layer in nature, as a galactic qost, just as lightning is the best representative of the lower radiant layer. 

Galaxies themselves do not emit matter and energy (unless they are very young or very old as quasars). They instead hold the stars (stellar qosts) and planets. 

The structure of a galaxy depends on the rotation and energy of its vortex. 

According to Descartes, a galaxy forms when qosts (which he calls the Air Element) collide with other qosts. The weaker and smaller ones revolve around the larger and stronger ones. These larger ones are naturally sepearated by their mutual repulsion from the need to retain their uniqueness.  

{{< q a="Descartes" c="The World Simplified" >}}
At the beginning, God placed every sort of inequality among these particles. They had all sorts of sizes, shapes, and dispositions to move or not to move, in all ways and in all directions. But that does not prevent them afterwards from having been rendered almost all fairly equal, especially those that remained an equal distance from the centers around which they were turning.

Thus, in a short time, all the parts were arranged in order. Each became more or less distant from the center around which it had taken its course, according as it was more or less large and agitated compared to the others.

These create Cartesian vortices that manifests as the swirling shapes of galaxies, just as cold and warm air create typhoons and tornadoes. The more warm air is present, the stronger the typhoon becomes. 

Likewise, the more Positive aether is behind the compiled ideas for a galaxy, the larger its area of influence, when it turns into a spiral galaxy.

Type | Age | Size
--- | --- | ---
Irregular | Young | Small
Spiral | Medium | Medium
Lenticular | Medium | Medium
Elliptical | Old | Large


A galaxy is therefore created in the following steps:

1. The Supreme has an idea for a universe
2. The Aether gets the ideas for that universe, packages them as organized ideas (qoa) for distribtion to spacetime (spatial layer)
3. Galactic qosts emerge in the spatial layer as irregular galaxies. These repel each other to create spacetime
4. The positive aether acts on the galactic qosts to create vortices
 <!-- increase its area of influence and size to create spiral galaxies -->
5. Stellar qosts emerge within this area to convert energy into matter and life which are then spread via supernovae
6. The galactic qost runs out of ideas (and feelings), leaving its stars behind as globular clusters. 
<!-- It turns into either empty space or a quasar -->
7. The stars die and become pure spacetime
