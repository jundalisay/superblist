The Quantum of Space-Time or Qost is the basic unit or substance in the spatial layer. It manifests as empty space.

In ancient natural philosophy, the aether was called the 'air' that filled all of Existence. 

Since it is one layer above the radiant layer which facilitates sight and touch, then it is not visible nor tangible. For example, you see that there is a space between you and your desk, but you cannot see the properties of that space.


## Detection and Size

The properties of qosts are detected through the reaction of light and particles from the lower layers. For example, we know that there is a black hole in the center of our galaxy because of how the stars go around it. Likewise, you see the space between you and the desk because of the existence of you and the desk. 

In planets, a planetary qost is detected by the behavior of mass around it. 

The qost of a heavenly body in Physics is the Schwarzschild Radius of that body. For example, a galaxy's qost is the event horizon of its supermassive black hole. 

The qost of a planet such as the Earth is the Schwarzschild Radius of the Earth which is 1 centimeter, while that of the sun is 3 kilometers.

The qost of a non-heavenly body, such as empty space, is the Planck length. 


## Attractive and Repulsive Forces

The affinity between the gravitational signatures of qosts lead to the attractive force which is called gravity by Physics. 

The differences between them lead to the repulsive force which is called the expansion of spacetime by Physics. This is based on the Law of Conservation of Idea.



<!-- Superhysics arrives at the qost of an object by flipping the Schwarzschild Radius to make the mass dependent on a [gravitational variable G](/material/fallacies/general-relativity) (not a constant) and by using a limiting tensor <code>s</code> instead of a constant speed of light <code>c</code>`. 

From here we can make important logical assertions: -->

This means that gravity does not come from mass, but from the qost that is in that mass. 



<!-- #### 1. The mass and size* of a qost is dependent on its gravitational signature

Since a qost represents a complex idea, then a small Schwarzschild Radius represents a small idea while large one represents a large one. 

> *As a 1-dimensional thing, a qost really does not have a size. It would be better to refer to it as an area of strongest influence. 



#### 2. The universe did not start from a material singularity -->

Rather, it began as an infinite number of discrete ideas streaming through onto physical reality via qosts. This is similar to your TV screen having no single starting point.

<!-- In this analogy, the LED bulb would represent a star or galaxy qost that emits its idea or feeling as the physical color and material from the star or galaxy. -->


<!-- #### 3. The expansion of spacetime really represents the development of those original potential ideas into actual ones

The universe can expand infinitely just as ideas can be developed, and mixed and matched into other ideas infinitely. The physical expansion does not mean that the universe started from a singularity or will collapse back into one. That kind of thinking arises from materialist thinking, by thinking that the material universe came from a material cause.
