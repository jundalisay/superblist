The Spatial Layer is divided into Upper, Middle, and Lower, with the Upper being metaphysical, and the Middle being quasi-physical.


Sublayer | Example | Qost 
--- | --- | ---
Upper | Metaphysical space and time | Spacetime Particles 
Mid | Multiverses | Galaxies and Quasars
Lower | Physical space and time | Material Things


The Upper Spacetime is the realm of mental space and time and is not physical. 

The Middle Spacetime allows acces to different universes, each one with different Physics. It is quasi-physical since it is the bridge between physical spacetime and the aether which is not bound by space nor time.

The Lower Spacetime is the realm that we can see. It manifests as the distance between objects on our table and that between two galaxies. It is physical since our 5 senses can clearly detect space and time.
