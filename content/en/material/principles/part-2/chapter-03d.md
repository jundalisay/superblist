## How Cartesian Physics explains both Quasars and Antimatter using the Single Principle of Reverse Vortices.

The previous chapter explained that supermassive black holes are large vortices made up of agitated spacetime particles. 

The friction of those invisible spacetime particles creates visible photon sparks that travel through spacetime.

Those photons then fizzle out, merging back with faraway spacetime particles, spreading energy everywhere. 

This everywhere energy then energizes that spacetime until certain areas have more energy than others. 

This imbalance creates new vortices similar to how high-low air pressure creates hurricanes from nowhere.

Those new vortices form new galaxies.

Those galaxies also produce solid matter as planets through their stars. 

Spacetime can convert itself to photons then convert back to spacetime, conserving energy. 

But the creation of matter means that more energy is crudified as time passes. This means that the universe should lose energy as it ages, just like adding flour to a glass of water will make it solid eventually, since flour is solid. 

So why is the universe still energetic?


## Quasars are Reverse Vortices

Cartesian Physics explains that this is because of reverse vortices.

These turn in the opposite direction than the rest, let's say clockwise when others turn counterclockwise. 

When a large powerful clockwise vortex touches a small counter vortex, the latter does not go with the former, as in a galaxy.

Instead it stays in stasis around the large vortex similar to 2 gears staying at the same spot. 

Other particles join in, creating large stasis similar to a traffic jam. 

In time, more particles get snagged in this traffic jam, leading to a pileup that compresses the particles sequentially like a meatgrinder. 

This leads to friction that creates much more light than a galaxy.

In time, matter as planets, asteroids, comets etc get snagged, crushed and spit out back as light and energy to be sent far away.

This de-crudifies energy and re-energizes the universe.

It follows that that the ratio of galaxies and quasars should be roughly similar. It means that some bright galaxies should be reclassified as quasars. 

These may be elliptical like normal galaxies but are distinguished by the lack of arms or distinctive features because of the difference of the motion of the parts and the center. 


## Antimatter as Reverse Vortices in the Radiant, Transformative, and Material Layers

These reverse vortices in the material Element (earth-aether) manifest as anti-matter, such as anti-proton and anti-hydrogen. 

These convert visible (counterclockwise) matter vortices back into invisible spacetime particles upon contact. 

The opposite rotations lead to friction, creating photons until both particles fizzle out and convert to spacetime, as consistency of Cartesian principles in macro and micro.

These principles mean that antimatter can be created more cheaply by changing the vortex rotation (called left or right hand spin by Modern Physics) directly with far less energy.

Unlike evil Einstein who used Physics to promote nuclear bombs, Cartesians have a higher moral and intellectual standard and will not use vortex science to make antimatter weapons to vaporize enemies back into spacetime particles. 

In fact, Cartesian Physics can delete ALL of Einstein's principles and replace them with Lorentz Relativity in Poincare spacetime, using aethereal vortices to explain both macro and micro.
