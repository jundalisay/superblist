The Positive and Negative Polarity of the Aethereal Layer manifests as clockwise and anti-clockwise rotation in the Spatial Layer. 

- The clockwise rotation represents the Negative Force 
- The anticlockwise rotation represents the Positive Force

This is most obviously seen in the rotation of high-energy galaxies which create long spiral arms.
