Instead of a Big Bang, the universe began as a "Big Bootup" or "Wakeup" when ideas flowed from the metaphysical plane onto the physical plane. 

These ideas flow down onto the five layers or elements of the Greeks, Hindus, and Chinese in five phases:

Phase | Layer | Physics Name | Sequence  
--- | --- | --- | ---
0 | Metaphysical | Pseudo-science | The pre-existing ideas as potentialities are deployed onto reality
1 | Aethereal | Higgs | The aether compiles the <!-- potential ideas as actual --> compound ideas as potential universes in the multiverse
2 | Spatial | Gravitation | The compiled ideas are sent through qosts as galaxies and then as stars. These create space and time, as well as gravity
3 | Radiant | Electromagnetism | The friction between qosts convert some of them into qols (photons) and qoes (electrons) in the stellar qosts
4 | Transformative | Weak force | The collisions convert some of the qosts into W and Z bosons (qout and qolt respectively) which are essential for fusion
5 | Material | Strong force | Finally, the strong force convert some of the qosts into quarks which form into hydrogen (M1)


Part 1 of Creation is explained in [another chapter](/material/principles/part-1/chapter-04b).

Here, we explain Phase 2 of the journey of the compiled or 'packaged' ideas from aethereal probability into physical reality in space and through time.  


## Phase 2: The Universe Takes Shape Thanks to Spacetime

<!-- all movement is sourced internally from an identity's gravitational signature. [Afterwards](/material/universal-relativity), the aether pushes that identity relative to other identities depending on what layer it is in: -->

Phase 1 of the existence of a Universe is when its Matrix boots up, or the Mind of Brahma starts to think about that Universe. We use the Matrix analogy for nonspiritual or close minded people. We use the Brahma analogy for spiritual or open minded ones.

This activates the aethereal layer to get the many ideas of the Supreme for that Universe. The ideas come from pre-existence and are transferred onto aethereal existence by the desire from the Positive Force of the Supreme. 

The aethereal ideas we call as 'quanta of aether' (qoas) as ideas which are meant for physical existence. These qoas then get funneled into nodes which we call quanta of spacetime (qosts) which exist in the layer under the aethereal layer.

The universe thus shifts from aetherel probability into spatial reality (i.e experiences space and time). 

<!-- 0. Metaphysical dimension: The pre-existing idea is deployed
1. Aethereal Layer: The aether (Higgs field to Physics) translates the idea onto physical reality through galaxies 
2. Spatial Layer: The galaxies create spacetime which allows the existence of quanta of spacetime (qoa) as stars 
3. Radiant Layer: The stars emit light and electromagnetism 
4. Transformative Layer: between particles convert neutrons into other types of particles
5. Material Layer: The particles stabilize as elements -->

  
### The Universe as a Matrix (or an App or TV screen)

<!-- These 1's and 0's then flood into existence. Unlike the original aethereal layer that had no zeros (and therefore no space), this current layer has space. So we call this the "spatial" layer.  

Unlike the Big Bang which created space from a material cause, our spatial layer was created by the flood of 1's and 0's entering existence. Thus, we can call it a Big Bootup, similar to a bootup of a computer that enables 1's and 0's to be created in its memory or computer-mind.  -->

We can think of the physical universe (with spacetime) as a giant computer memory that generates virtual objects.

The stream of ideas from the aethereal layer enter this virtual reality through specific placeholder blocks or nodes in this universe-RAM or universal-memory.  <!-- combination of 1's and 0's that stream down into physical space do it through  in the mind or memory of the universe. --> This is to maintain the identity of each idea and not let it get mixed up with other ideas.  

For example, a smartphone has two kinds of memory:
- Phone memory where the apps are run
- SD Card memory where the apps are stored and are usually larger than the phone memory

The spatial layer is the phone memory which runs the operating system which has the apps. 

The aethereal layer is the SD card which can have far more apps ready to be installed (have potential existence). 


{{< img src="/graphics/apps.jpg" alt="Apps in a Matrix" cap="We are inside a Matrix just as our apps are inside a phone" >}}

Each app must be separate from other apps, otherwise there'll be an error*.  


> *We assert that the Supreme does not make mistakes or bugs in Its design for a universe.


**We call these nodes or blocks as the quanta of spacetime of qosts.** 

These qosts are invisible since they are above the Radiant (Electromagnetic) Layer. For human purposes, we can designate that each qost has a size of 1 Planck length and changes every 1 Planck time. 

These fill empty space and perform the following critical tasks:
- constraining and isolating each universe from each other
- constraining the speed of light
- facilitating the expansion of the universe which allows evolution of things in the universe
- facilitating the universe-scale attraction and repulsion, as opposed to the limited attraction and repulsion facilitated by electromagnetism
- facilitating the creation of matter and energy via galaxies and quasars



## Types of Qosts
 <!-- that Become Galaxies as Vortices -->

The qosts that contain the most complex ideas, such as those for a galaxy, turn into vortices that eventually manifest those galaxies.  

{{< q a="Descartes" c="The World Simplified" >}}
Before God divided it, the pure aether was singular. When it began to be divided, its division began in one part and spread out to all its parts as equally as it could. However, this equality of division could not be perfect.. Instead, each division happened as circular motions with different centers. This is because God gave each particle a different motion. Nearer the centers, the particles were naturally less agitated and smaller. Farther from the centers, the particles were more agitated and larger.. The strongest particles were the largest ones. These created the largest circles.
{{< /q >}}


<!-- Each qost is a starting point for galaxies and stars. It becomes a holder for planets or other heavenly body that are produced from those galaxies and stars.  -->
<!-- do not emit their own energy.  -->


There are 3 types of qosts just as there are 3 types of leptons in the Radiant Layer and 3 color charges in the Material Layer:
 <!--matter particles (matter, antimatter): -->

1. Major bodies
2. Minor bodies
3. Spacetime particles


<!-- However, unlike a computer's memory that is limited and predefined, the qosts of the universe is infinite. It is arbitrarily set by the aethereal layer above it (or operating behind it). This is similar to Firefox browser having the computer's operating system (OS) working behind the scenes at all times. If the OS shuts down, then the Firefox browser shuts down too. Thus, if the idea "stops" in the aethereal layer, then its physical version will likewise disappear according to the rules of physicality.   -->

<!-- These qosts start out as 1-dimensional points that repel each other to create 2-dimensions, then 3-dimensions, and finally 4 physically-observable dimensions. --> 

The major bodies are:
- galaxies
- quasars

These galaxies and quasars exert the force of attraction and repulsion.
- Dark Matter is the Physics name for the attractive force within a galaxy or quasar
- Dark Energy is the repulsive force between them

The minor types of qosts manifest as everything else, such as:
- stars
- planets
- asteroids
- moons
- material things

The attractive force with these manifests as gravity. The repulsive force manifests as the vacuum of space. 

The last type are mere spacetime particles. These have just enough energy to make it through to the Physical Domain. 


<!-- Such nodes or points exert a natural force called gravity to facilitate the coversion of aethereal ideas and feelings into physical matter and energies.  -->

<!-- In our app analogy, this is the "run-time" of the app, as opposed to the "compile-time" of the aethereal layer.   -->

Physics believes that gravity comes from material mass. However, this is impossible in our model since matter is the final 5th layer and doesn't exist yet at this point.

Physicists make this mistake because mass is so tied and dependent on gravity that they are always perceived together. 

<!-- it cannot be separated by physical means, thought it can be manipulated by mind or metaphysical means.  -->

<!-- and so dark matter has mass, but black holes and supermassive black holes have singularity wherein the laws of physics do not hold. To get rid of this absurdity, Superphysics views mass as coming from gravity in accordance with our five-layer model wherein material mass is the lowest and most subordinate layer. We can say that mass is the effect of, and is dependent on, gravity and its subordination to the aether, now known as the Higgs field.  -->

**Thus, we define gravity as an inherent relational force between gravitational signatures.** This inherent quality is defined in the aethereal layer.

<!-- inherent force in each qost which depends on the inherent quality of the ideas that are meant for it.**  -->



Stars come from galaxies and are subservient to them, just as planets and asteroids come from stars and are subservient. This means the gravitation of the two are different:
- stars or stellar qosts follow the inverse square law
- galaxy qosts follow the vortex differences 

Instead of dark matter, we call the attractive force that binds galaxies as galactic gravitational territories. 

Instead of dark energy, we call the repulsive force that causes the expansion of space as the constant division of the qosts which allow the potential existence of new qost-identities.

<!-- through the emergence of   binds galaxies as galactic gravitational territories.  -->
<!-- (Descartes' vortices as Cartesian votices) from the aether (Higgs Field) -->

<!-- In our computing analogy:
- The aethereal layer is the Windows Operating System
- The spatial layer is the Firefox browser within Windows 
  - The other universes are the other browsers also running alongside Firefox, such as Internet Explorer, Chrome, and Opera.  -->


## The Creation Process from Idea to Physical Reality

Galactic qosts emerge arbitrarily onto the aether (or out of the aether) as one-dimensional points which repel each other to preserve their identity*.

> *We call this the Law of Conservation of Idea

<!-- , for the same existential reason that mass and energy are conserved. --> 

This creates the concept of spacetime between each of the points.

Pythagoras called these 1D points as monads:

{{< q a="Iamblichus" c="The Life of Pythagoras" >}}
The monad was the indivisible point and the first cause. The duad was the first line or interval. The triad had more intervals and lines. The tetrad was solid.
{{< /q >}}


{{< youtube e7rRQEq9C60 >}}


The spacetime layer thus converts the 1-dimensional galactic qosts into 2-dimensional, and then into 3-dimensional nodes the more qosts emerge. This continues until finally the nodes lead to 4 physically-observable dimensions* through the concept of time. This leads to the 4-dimensional 'Minkowski' spacetime of physics.

> *There can be up to 6 spacetime dimensions. Above that, spacetime no longer exists and experience becomes fully immersive and totally arbitrary. 


<!-- Physics calls the repulsion between galaxies as 'dark energy', while the spatial relation between galactic and stellar qosts as 'dark matter'. 
- Instead of dark energy, we call it 'gap energy', as the energy that creates the spatial gap between galaxies. 
- Instead of dark matter, we call it 'area of influence*', as the area where the galaxy's idea can be deployed.  -->

<!-- > *This name will be consistent when explaining Cartesian vortices, and anti-gravity as the levitating monk. The term 'dark matter' is relatively useless -->


The collisions and friction between the qosts within a galaxy crudify them down into the Radiant layer where they convert into quanta of light (qol) and quanta of electricity (qoe).

{{< q a="Descartes" c="The World Simplified" >}}
The aether particles that broke off from air-aether during collisions gained more speed because they had to travel farther at the same amount of time. They became the fire-aether.
{{< /q >}}

These qols (pronounced *khol*) and qoes (pronounced *khoe*) become the stars, as stellar qosts, that then emerge within the gravitational territory of the galactic qost. This new star-identity gains its own gravitational territory.


## The Creation of Life and Matter

The qosts compress the qols and qoes around a stellar vortex until a star is formed. In time, this star explodes due to the excess pressure from those qosts. 

The explosion spits out:
- material particles as quanta of matter or qoms (pronounced koms) in the physical domain
- immaterial particles as aethereal unit-minds or souls 
  - These souls inhabit the material particles in order to lead to living organisms


<!-- life  quanta of matter or qoms (pronounced koms) in the physical domain -->

 <!-- with the star's gravitational territory. These qoms gather into energetic qosts that form planets and moons.   -->


<!-- It is the one that attracts energy in order to create both matter and life. In the process, this disrupts the homogenity of energy (equilibrium of thermodynamics).

This is similar to how our boredom is disrupted by us having new ideas. Using our earlier "Big Wakeup" analogy, we can say that the Mind of the Supreme was bored or sleeping, and so It created the universe by thinking or waking up. 

The stirred energy then clump at the qosts which are then acted on by the other layers in successive phases:

- Phase 3: The electromagnetic layer turns the clumped energy into electrons or "quantum of electricity" (qoe) and photons "quantum of light" (qol) 
- Phase 4: The weak force of the transformative layer turn the electrons into neutrons "quantum of radioactivity" (qor)
- Phase 5: The strong force turn neutrons into protons as quarks (quantum of matter or qom) via gluons -->


<!-- These lead to the first shining stars. The protons in them then make up the basic elements which are then spread throughout space through the explosion of the qost, as a supernova. The exploded matter and unconverted energy are then re-clumped in the same qost to repeat the process until all the energy is converted into matter.  -->


<!-- ## Spreading Ideas to the Universe

The qost spreads its ideas onto the universe through its light and radiation, and materially through its supernova. The exploded matter from a supernova  acquires a piece of the original qost as to be able to attract energies on its own and become a manifested idea as a planet and everything on that planet.
 -->

<!--  , which then allows itself to gather other matter in order to become stars and planets. -->
