Qosts manifest invisibly as spacetime particles, the smallest of which are of the Planck length. These have only the minimum energy and idea-complexity that are required for physical reality. 


There are 3 types of qosts just as there are 3 types of leptons in the Radiant Layer and 3 color charges in the Material Layer:

Sublayer | Qost Type 
--- | ---
Upper | Spacetime Particles
Middle | Galaxies and Quasars
Lower | Stars, Planets, Moons, Material Things


Since the Spatial Layer is superior to the other 3 Layers, we can classify the qosts according to the 4 Layers:

<!-- The qosts with more energy and idea-complexity become heavenly bodies and are classified below: -->

Layer | Physics Name/s | Superphysics Name
--- | --- | --- 
Spatial | Supermassive Black Hole | Galactic Qost (galaxy), Galactic Reverse Qost (quasar)
Radiant | Black Hole |  Stellar Qost (star)
Transformative | Neutron Star | Transformative Qost (neutron star), Transformative Reverse Qost (pulsar)
Material | Planet, Moon | Material Qost


### Galactic Qosts or Galaxy

![Galaxy](/photos/physics/galaxy.jpg)

A galaxy has a galactic qost as its center or controlling factor or defining identity. 


### Galactic Reverse Qosts or Quasars

![Quasar](/photos/physics/quasar.jpg)

A quasar is a galactic qost that rotates in a clockwise direction. This creates more friction than a galaxy, leading to more light.

It also churns matter back into energy, acting as a matter-to-energy recycle bin. This allows the universe to prevent a thermal death. An example is the quasar TON 618. 


### Stellar Qosts or Stars

![Stars](/photos/physics/star.jpg)

A star is a young qost that is influenced by the Radiant Layer. It converts energy to matter (non-expressive mind) and life (expressive mind).



### Transformative Qosts or Neutron Stars

![Space](/photos/physics/pulsar.jpg)

A neutron star is an adult qost that is influenced by the transformative layer. It converts matter into heavier matter and complex life and 'explodes' it to the universe.


### Transformative Reverse Qosts or Pulsars

A pulsar is a neutron star that rotates in a clockwise direction. Like a quasar, it converts matter into energy, manifesting as pulsations.


### Black Hole or Dead Qosts

![Black hole](https://sorasystem.sirv.com/photos/blackholes800.jpg)

<!-- In Physics, a black hole is hole in the fabric of spacetime which has a singularity in its center. It is said that singularity is an area where the laws of physics break down, which is an absurdity.

To get rid of this absurdity, Superphysics instead calls it a dark qost which is a star (stellar qost) that has done its job of creating matter and will diffuse slowly into dark matter. Going into the center of a dark qost would be just like going to the center of any star.  -->

A star that has run out of energy and has deployed all its ideas becomes a 'dark star' or dead qost. 

It will slowly diffuse back into spacetime, similar to a typhoon that has lost its energy and diffuses back into the atmosphere. 

 <!-- pure gravitation as a remnant qost or decayed black hole.  -->

Energy and matter that go into a dead qost will find itself 'lensing' around it.

 <!-- since it does not occupy spacetime.  -->

<!-- Going into a center of a dead qost would just be like    -->

Recent proof of black holes decaying into spacetime is in the [Palomar 5 cluster](https://www.space.com/black-holes-overrun-star-cluster-palomar-5-star-cluster) which is an ancient collection of stars that have turned into black holes.


<!-- ### Dark Matter (Decayed black holes) or Remnant qosts

![Palomar cluster](https://sorasystem.sirv.com/photos/palomar.jpg)

Dark qosts lose their identity and disperse themselves onto spacetime as remnant qosts. In computing, memory is finite and so virtual objects have to be cleaned up or 'garbage collected' to give a chance for new objects to exist. But the universe is infinite and so the dead stars do not need to be recycled.

 <!-- that, in turn, will turn into pure gravitation (dark matter) as empty (void) space.  -->



### Material Qosts or Planets, Moons, and Material Things

![Mars](https://sorasystem.sirv.com/photos/mars.jpg)

A planet is a material qost that orbits a stellar qost. It may have its own subqosts as moons and objects like apples, cars, and rocks. <!-- Unlike stellar qosts, material qosts solidify into material bodies as a consequence of the influence of the material layer. -->



### Spacetime Qosts or Empty Space

Empty space is made up of invisible spacetime particles that fill up the universe.




## Other Forms of Gravity in Other Universes lead to Different Spacetime 'structures'

![Dark Matter](https://sorasystem.sirv.com/photos/darkmatter.jpg)

In this universe, the aether decided that galactic qosts must manifest as 1-dimensional points. In other universes within the multiverse however, the aether might decide for gravitation to manifest as 4-D blobs, 3-D planes, or 2-D lines. These then would create different spacetimes. However, the Superphysics would be the same.

{{< q a="Socrates" c="The Republic by Plato Simplified" >}}
Three-dimensional solid geometry should have naturally followed two-dimensional geometry. But three-dimensional solid geometry is in such a ludicrous state. It made me pass over it, and go on to astronomy as the motion of solids.

This distinction between 2-D and 3-D geometry was the focus of Johanes Kepler and Kepler's laws which is the basis of our theory of gravitation which is opposite that of Newton and Einstein. 




## Mini FAQ

1. What is the difference between a qost and a gravitational signature `G`?

A `G` is like a barcode sequence, while a qost is the ink that makes up the barcode. 


2. Does this mean everything in the universe is a qost?

No. Qosts only apply from the spatial layer down to the material layer. 

The higher aether layer is not made up of qosts, but of qoas (quantum of aether). These are identities that are not affected by physical gravity nor spacetime.

The most common example of qoas are ideas. The idea of love is not bound by spacetime. Nor does love attract people to it. Rather, the idea of love is the byproduct of the experience of the gravitation between two things that have the same frequency. Likewise, hatred is the idea of the repulsion of two entities.


3. How does qosts affect quantum physics?

Quantum physics was invented before the advent of computers and virtual reality. Its fundamental concept is the 'field' which came from electromagnetism (EM) of the 20th century. This field is bound by spacetime (the layer above EM).

The problem with the field-paradigm is that the qosts work *above* the EM layer. They work under the aether layer which is *NOT* bound by spacetime. <!-- In our computer analogy, the which is  or an abstract RAM of a computer instead of fields. --> This gives qosts and Material Superphysics more freedom than quantum physics on how to explain phenomena like gravitation and the collapse of probability into reality. 

For example, Material Superphysics has 8 dimensions just as a virtual machine (VM) can have virtual machines inside it, which in turn can have VM's inside. In contrast, a quantum field cannot have fields in it that have subfields, since electromagnetism doesn't work that way. Physics puts the fields *on top* of each other, but Superphysics puts the dimensions *inside* each other.
