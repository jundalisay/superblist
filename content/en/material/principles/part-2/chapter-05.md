Everything is expanding, even your own atoms. 

In the 1630's Descartes wrote about how the universe works. 

According to him, the universe began when spacetime became divided. These divisions led to diverse vortices that later became galaxies, stars, and planets. 

This division did not stop after those heavenly bodies were created. It still continues every millisecond. 

This now manifests as the expansion of the universe which is revealed by the cosmic red shift.

It means that we are literally physically larger now than a moment ago. We are not able to perceive any change or difference because everything else is also getting larger.

We are only able to detect this size-increase not from our own planets or galaxies, but from the gaps between those galaxies where there is no matter to be increased. Descartes calls them 'superficies' (surfaces), which we rename into 'edges'.

These edges are traversed by photons from galaxies to ours. It is there where the photons are stretched (relative to themselves before they entered those edges or gaps) as to become red shifts. 

These edges draw the territorial boundary of the galaxy (gravitational field to Newtonian Physics). This territory is where the size-increase happens internally as a single unit, independent of other galaxies.

This is similar to the Earth having a gravitational field or territory which keeps the Earth as a single unit. It explains why we and the atmosphere are not flung away by the rotation of the Earth.  

The territory of a galaxy likewise keeps its contents as a single unit, making the size-increase uniform on its stars and matter. 

Descartes assures us that the rate of division of spacetime is also uniform everywhere in the universe. This then leads to the constant speed of light which travels on that spacetime. 

This means that if the rate of division were slower, then the top speed of light would also be slower.

This removes the need for any dark matter or dark energy, since the nature of the spacetime particles already accounts for those phenomena.

This also implies that the speed of light is not really decreed by spacetime, but by the aether that divides that spacetime. 

The division of spacetime is an inexhaustible source of energy which Nikola Tesla tried to tap as cosmic energy. Unlike solar power which comes from a single source as the sun, this spacetime energy is everywhere, though extremely weak.

By processing Descartes' principles, in theory, division-energy can be extracted by creating a vortex with defined edges from where the energy from spacetime division (air-aether) can be downgraded into electrical energy (fire-aether).

This downgrading has metaphysical consequences though. This is why advanced species would predictably rather use the fusion of material hydrogen as their main energy source or base load, and use spacetime-division only as a backup or starter.


<!-- In Cartesian Physics, the expansion is accelerating because spacetime is being divided at a constant rate. 

However, the diversity within those divisions is increasing. 

So it leads to the perception that the expansion is accelerating. 

Note that the accelerated expansion is only through the red shift in the macro scale, and conversely by length contraction by Lorentz Relativity.   -->
