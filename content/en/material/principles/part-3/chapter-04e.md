In Superphysics, electrons are positively charged, in line with the Positive Force, while protons are negatively charged, in line with the Negative Force.

This is why 'negative' ions make us feel positive, and 'positive' ions make us feel negative.

The setting of electrons are negatively charged came from [Benjamin Franklin](https://whyy.org/articles/does-our-confusing-electrical-nomenclature-start-with-ben-franklins-theory).

 <!-- who made a mistake when he called electrons as negative.  -->

Rather than confuse everyone by calling the negative as positive, we would rather call:
- the negative as 'feminine charge'
- the positive as a 'masculine charge'
- the neutral as a 'bisexual charge'

{{< q c="Kybalion" >}}
We shall use the word "Feminine" in the place of "Negative" in speaking of that pole of activity.

## Male and Female

The attraction between protons, electrons, and neutrons intuitively follow this naming convention, just as Shiva is male and Shakti is female.

Likewise, charges can change from positive to negative and vice versa just a male can choose to become a female, though far less common.



### Qors (Electrons)

Quantum or Medium | Spin | Physics Charge | Mass | Description
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
qor1 (muon) | 1/2 | -1 | | 
qor2 (electron) | 1/2 | -1 | | 
qor3 (tau) | 1/2 | -1 | 1776.86 MeV/c2 | Heavy electron
mor (photon) | 0 | none | none |  


<!-- | Neutrino | |  | none |  |  |
| Muon Neutrino | |  | none |  |  |
| Tau Neutrino | |  | none |  |  | -->




### Weak Bosons (Qots)

| Physics Name | Superphysics Name | Spin | Physics Charge | Mass | Description |

| W Z Bosons | qot | 1/2 | +-1 | |  |
| Higgs Boson |  | 0 | none |  |  |

- MB for W Boson
- TB for Z Boson
- RB for Photons

## So What's the Use of Male and Female Charges? 

The charges are a consequence of identities in the Radiant layer charting a course towards the Material layer via the Transformative layer. Using genders allows a intuitive and more diversified classification that is more robust than mere positive or negative. For example, binary male and female has variations as:

- lesbian
- gay
- agender
- cisgender
- non-binary
- two-spirit
- genderfluid    

These then lead to different combination-dynamics such as:

- male + genderfluid
- lesbian + gay
- lesbian + agender
- etc

Such combinations then have different properties which might be useful in the real world. These could lead to new specialized compounds or materials. Coming up with new compounds would be more difficult in a non-intuitive system that merely has positive-negative. 


<!-- ## Quantum of Electricity 

As you can see, we call electron a (female) qoe [pronouncued "khoe"], and the tau a heavy qoe. We can replace all arbitrary names with this more natural system.
