Descartes explained that these are caused by the gravitational territories of stars and galaxies, and not by their mass or the matter within them.


In Cartesian Physics, there are 2 kinds of refraction of starlight (gravitational lensing):

1. Galactic

2. Stellar
<!-- 3. Material -->


## Galactic Lensing 


## Stellar Lensing

The 1919 Eddington experiment is a stellar gravitational lensing.

Galactic gravitational lensing are the more common ones such as galaxy cluster Abell 1689.



This is why Cartesian Physics predicts that there is none or insignificant lensing in planets (as material lensing).
