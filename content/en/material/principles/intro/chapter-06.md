Material Superphysics leads to new technologies by using all of the 5 Layers. Since Physics already knows the 3 of the 5, we will focus on the remaining 2. 

Layer | Technologies
--- | ---
Aethereal | Artificial Sentience
Spatial | Teleportation, Levitation, Fusion Power, Spacetime Power
Radiant | Light-based Computing 
Transformative | More Specialized Compounds 
Material | Stronger Materials
