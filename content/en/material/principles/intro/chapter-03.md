The Law of Conservation of Idea of Superphysics states that everything in reality is an idea of the Supreme. 

All such ideas:
- pre-exist
- cannot be created nor destroyed, and
- are unique.

This uniqueness means that each idea has its own properties as imbued by its Creator.

These inherent properties are called its dharma or true nature. The inherent property of a unique idea or object is called svadharma.

These ideas get deployed in the physical domain where they manifest as identities. For example:
- a leaf is a separate identity from its tree
- a rock is a separate identity from its mountain
- a son is a separate identity from its parents and family  

Each identity is unique. In Physics, this uniqeuness manifests as:
- The Pauli Exclusion Principle
- The fact that you do not go 'through' your chair and occupy the same space tiat it does 

This uniqueness is denoted in reality by a metaphysical signature which determines:

1. What Layer or physical body it exists as
2. What potential motions it can do 

Since motion is more striking to the mind, we call these as gravitational signatures or `G`. 


<!-- interaction between these identities creates movement  -->


### The Gravitational Signature Determines What Layer the Identity Exists In

The `G` is used to find out what Layer the identity exists in. This denoted by the subscript `l`.  

<!-- the strength or energy `E` of the identity depending on what Layer <i><sub>`l`</sub></i> it is in.  -->

{{< img src="/graphics/super/egl.png" alt="E = Gl" >}}

<!-- The resulting energy can be used to reveal the G just as the G can be used to reveal the potential energy of the identity. 

This relationship has different manifestations in the different layers.


<!-- is `E :: Gl` in the Material layer*
- Radioactivity or non-radioactivity is `E :: Gl` in the  layer
-  is `E :: Gl` in the  layer
-  is `E :: Gl` in the  layer
- `` is `E :: Gl` in the Aetheric layer
- `E = G` is `E :: Gl` in the Metaphysical layer -->


<!-- We replace material mass `m` with metaphysical `G` which represents the inherent gravity in every discrete identity, whether that identity be a thing, mind, idea, or feeling.

This `G` is the "gravitational signature" and is really supposed to be `D` as dharma or `T` as tao or True Nature of Socrates. But that would turn away Westerners who have a distaste for non-Western ideas (which is a no-no if we are to unify the human species and put everyone, East and West, 'on the same page'). 

So we can stick with `G` as invented by the British Newton. 
- Like Newton, Socrates would think that this `G` is inherent to the body as what "objects carry in them"
- But unlike Newton who believed that `G` came from a material mass, the Socratic `G` comes from a metaphysical "true nature" which the Hindus call Dharma. 

In this way, the Socratic `G` still ends up as `D` if the thinking person chases it down. You could even say that `G` is the metaphysical DNA of everything in existence that dictates what movements it can do, and actually manifests as the DNA in physical living cells.

<!-- . In non-quasar galaxies, this DNA is in the gravitational signature of every star, just as the DNA of our bodies is in each cell. -->

<!-- This `G` then has five versions*, one for each of five layers represented by l.  -->

<!-- > *You can think of nature having 5 types of gravities. Newtonian gravity is type 5, Einsteinian gravity is type 3 and is called magnetism.  -->

<!-- In this way, the resulting equation E = Gl called [the Eagle](/superphysics/principles/chapter-04c) serves as a template that holds all the equations of potential motion:

> *Superphysics uses [qualimath](/superphysics/principles/chapter-04) which converts `=` into `::` -->


### The Gravitational Signature is also the Foundation of Motion

Aside from determining the Layer, a gravitational signature also determines the range of motions that arise from the attraction or repulsion by its affinity or difference with the other signatures, whether they are from objects, entities, or minds within the same layer.

Lower layers are affected by higher layers, but higher layers are unaffected by the lower. For example, light is affected by gravity, but gravity is not affected by light.


Layer | Positive or Attraction | Negative or Repulsion 
--- | --- | ---
Aethereal | Attraction of related ideas and minds | Replusion of opposing ones
Spatial | Attraction to massive objects (vortices) | Repulsion to immaterial objects (non-vortices)
Radiant | Attraction of opposite charges | Repulsion of like charges
Transformative | Noninteraction that leads to nondecay | Interaction that decays the particle
Material | Gluons that form matter | Particle collisions that destroy that matter and convert them to spacetime)
 <!-- through the Law of Conservation of Idea -->

These signatures take the form of different equations depending on the layer that they are in. 

Layer | Movement 
--- | ---
Aethereal | `E :: GA`
Spatial | `E :: G1 : G2`
Radiant | `E = mc^2`
Transformative | Feynman diagrams 
Material | `w = mg`  -->

In theory, this means that peace and harmony can be achieved granularly by knowing the Gravitational signatures of everyone in order to reduce the repulsion of minds, and generally by imposing higher-layer ideas like virtue (this virtue-based socio-political system is then the job of Social Superphysics)" >}}


## Leads to Technologies 

In Material Superphysics, gravitational signatures lead to technology-solutions, just as they lead to social solutions in Social Superphysics and medical solutions in Bio Superhysics:

- Fusion is solved by knowing the gravitational signature of hydrogen
- Levitation is solved by knowing the gravitational signature of the object
- Teleportation is solved by estimating the gravitational signature of the object at the other location 
- Time travel is solved by the same estimation but with the additional factor of the object's past. This is why time travel to the past will be easier than a travel to the future.
