The Law of Conservation of Idea of Superphysics states that everything in reality is an idea of the Supreme. 

All such ideas:
- pre-exist
- cannot be created nor destroyed, and
- are unique.

This uniqueness means that each idea has its own properties as imbued by its Creator.

These inherent properties are called its dharma or true nature. The inherent property of a unique idea or object is called svadharma.

These ideas get deployed in the physical domain where they manifest as identities. For example:
- a leaf is a separate identity from its tree
- a rock is a separate identity from its mountain
- a son is a separate identity from its parents and family  

Each identity is unique and has its own unique signature. The differences between these signatures creates attractive or repulsive motion. Because of this, we call them as gravitational signatures or `G`. 

<!-- interaction between these identities creates movement  -->


## The Eagle for the Material Layer

We use the `G` to find out the strength or energy `E` of the identity depending on what Layer <i><sub>`l`</sub></i> it is in. 

{{< img src="/graphics/super/egl.png" alt="E = Gl" >}}

The resulting energy can be used to reveal the G just as the G can be used to reveal the potential energy of the identity. 

This relationship has different manifestations in the different layers.

Layer | Eagle 
--- | ---
Aethereal | `E :: GA`
Spatial | `E :: G1 : G2`
Radiant | `E = mc^2`
Transformative | Feynman diagrams 
Material | `w = mg` 


<!-- is `E :: Gl` in the Material layer*
- Radioactivity or non-radioactivity is `E :: Gl` in the  layer
-  is `E :: Gl` in the  layer
-  is `E :: Gl` in the  layer
- `` is `E :: Gl` in the Aetheric layer
- `E = G` is `E :: Gl` in the Metaphysical layer -->


<!-- We replace material mass `m` with metaphysical `G` which represents the inherent gravity in every discrete identity, whether that identity be a thing, mind, idea, or feeling.

This `G` is the "gravitational signature" and is really supposed to be `D` as dharma or `T` as tao or True Nature of Socrates. But that would turn away Westerners who have a distaste for non-Western ideas (which is a no-no if we are to unify the human species and put everyone, East and West, 'on the same page'). 

So we can stick with `G` as invented by the British Newton. 
- Like Newton, Socrates would think that this `G` is inherent to the body as what "objects carry in them"
- But unlike Newton who believed that `G` came from a material mass, the Socratic `G` comes from a metaphysical "true nature" which the Hindus call Dharma. 

In this way, the Socratic `G` still ends up as `D` if the thinking person chases it down. You could even say that `G` is the metaphysical DNA of everything in existence that dictates what movements it can do, and actually manifests as the DNA in physical living cells.

<!-- . In non-quasar galaxies, this DNA is in the gravitational signature of every star, just as the DNA of our bodies is in each cell. -->

<!-- This `G` then has five versions*, one for each of five layers represented by l.  -->

<!-- > *You can think of nature having 5 types of gravities. Newtonian gravity is type 5, Einsteinian gravity is type 3 and is called magnetism.  -->

<!-- In this way, the resulting equation E = Gl called [the Eagle](/superphysics/principles/chapter-04c) serves as a template that holds all the equations of potential motion:

> *Superphysics uses [qualimath](/superphysics/principles/chapter-04) which converts `=` into `::` -->


### Gravitational Signatures are the Foundation of Motion

A gravitational signature produces attractive or repulsive motion by its affinity or difference with the signatures of other existing identities, whether they be objects, entities, or minds within the same layer*. 

Lower layers are affected by higher layers, but higher layers are unaffected by the lower. For example, light is affected by gravity, but gravity is not affected by light.


Layer | Positive or Attraction | Negative or Repulsion 
--- | --- | ---
Material | Gluons that form matter | Nuclear explosions and destroy that matter (convert back to spacetime)
Transformative | Noninteraction that leads to nondecay | Interaction that decays the particle
Radiant | Attraction of opposite charges | Repulsion of like charges
Spatial | Attraction to massive objects (vortices) | Repulsion to immaterial objects (non-vortices)
Aethereal | Attraction of related ideas and minds | Replusion of opposing ones

In theory, this means that peace and harmony can be achieved granularly by knowing the Gravitational signatures of everyone in order to reduce the repulsion of minds, and generally by imposing higher-layer ideas like virtue (this virtue-based socio-political system is then the job of Social Superphysics)" >}}
