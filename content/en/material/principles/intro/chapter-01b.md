The Probability Layer is above and covers the aethereal layer. This means it is above existence  and is only theoretical.  We can also call this pre-existence that binds existence.

This layer is static and is driven by the desire of either the Creator or the createe.

{{< q a="Montesquieu" c="Spirit of the Laws, Book 1" >}}
Intelligent beings might have laws of their own making. But they also have some which they never made. Before there were intelligent beings, they were a possibility.
