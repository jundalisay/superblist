Chapter 1 divided reality into 5 Layers.

## The Hierarchy of the Layers and Sublayers

This chapter divides each layer into 3 sublayers, a higher, middle, and a lower part. This matches the 3 Influences or Gunas.

Energy and the 2 Forces manifest via Media differently in the 5 layers and each of the sublayers.

Sublayer | Quantum | Media | 2 Forces
--- | --- | --- | ---
Upper Aethereal | Mind  | Sound | Existence or Nonexistence
Middle Aethereal | Qoa (Idea) | Sound | Consonance or Dissonance
Lower Aethereal | Thought | Sound | Consonance or Dissonance
Upper Spatial | Metaphysical Spacetime (Multiverses) |  |  
Middle Spatial | Galactic Qost | Universe | Fast or slow
Lower Spatial | Qost | Space and time within a universe | Gravity or Anti-gravity
Upper Radiant | Muon | Mor1 (Infrared) | Bright or Dark
Middle Radiant | Electron | Mor2 (Visible Light) | Energetic or non-energetic
Lower Radiant | Tau | Mor3 (UV Light) | Magnetic or Nonmagnetic
Upper Transformative | Z Boson |  |  
Middle Transformative | W- Boson | Radioactivity | Persistence or Decay
Lower Transformative | W+ Boson |  | 
Upper Material | Up Quark | Gas | Persistence | Blue Charge
Middle Material | Down Quark | Liquid | Persistence | Green Charge
Lower Material | Strange Quark | Solid | Persistence | Red Charge


<!-- . | Mid | Color Charge Quark qom | Stability or Instability
. | Lower | Color Charge Quark qom | Identity or Change -->

 
<!-- ## How Energy and the 2 Forces Manifest in the Sublayers -->

<!-- Layer | Energy | Manifestation
--- | --- | ---
Upper Aethereal | Strength of idea or feeling | 
Lower Aethereal | Strength of idea or feeling | Sound
Upper Spatial | Strength of a vortex (black hole) | Gravity
Lower Spatial | Strength of a vortex (black hole) | Gravity
Upper Radiant | Energy in a photon or electron | Heat and Light
Lower Radiant | Energy in a photon or electron | Heat and Light
Upper Transformative | Energy in a W Z boson | Stability
Transformative | Energy in a W Z boson | Stability
Material | Energy in an atomic nucleus | Identity -->


<!-- The ancient Hindus asserted that reality was made up of 5 Elements or Layers: Akasha, Vayu, Tejas, Jala, Bhumi.

Modern Physics calls these 5 Layers nowadays as: Aether, Spacetime, Electromagnetism, Weak Force, Strong Force respectively. 

We rename this as the Aethereal, Spatial, Radiant, Tranformative, and Material Layers in order to emphasize their qualities and make them intuitive and easy to understand.  -->


<!-- Energy manifests differently in each layer:
- In the Aethereal layer, it manifests as sound
- In the Spatial layer, it manifests as heat
- In the Radiant layer, it manifests as light
- In the Transformative layer, it manifests as stability 
- In the Material layer, it manifests as identity -->

Everything in existence therefore has varying degrees of identifiability, stability, visuality, temperature, and audibility. 

The layers work in a hierarchy, with the aether being most superior, and matter being the most inferior. This explains why gravity affects light and heat, but light and heat does not affect gravity. 

For example, adding heat to a rock will not make it float. Shining light on a rock will reveal its identity, but not make it heavier or lighter. 


## Unity or Disunity Instead of Order or Disorder

In Physics, energy leads to the concept of entropy which is the order or disorder of systems. 

Instead of order or disorder, Superphysics uses the words 'unity' or 'disunity'. This is most useful in the aethereal layer where sounds can be united in a chorus, or disunited as noise.

It would be better to say that a family, society, or sports team is 'united' instead of 'orderly'. Similarly, a car is united when all its parts are kept together, and disunited when it suffers a car crash or is left to rust. 

- Unity is facilitated by the Positive Force of Nature
  - This is called Yang in Taoism and Shiva in Hinduism.   
- Disunity is facilitated by the Negative Force of Nature.
  - This is called Yin in Taoism and Shakti in Hinduism.   


Science was created by the Europeans who built knowledge from the bottom material layer -- the most inferior but most obvious one. From the bottom, they worked their way up to the Transformative Layer via Chemistry and Nuclear Reactions, and the Radiant (Electromagnetic Layer) via Electricity.

This led to a messy, fragmented, and non-intuitive system of knowledge. For example:
- Physics is now split into Particle Physics and Quantum Physics
- Medicine is split into Western Medicine and Alternative Medicine 
- Economics is split into Microeconomics, Macroeconomics, Behavioral Economics, Welfare Economics, etc. 

We clean up this mess by:
- putting all knowledge into the 5 Layers, and
- adding the 2 Forces as its operators.

These then create everything in reality.

For example, the 2 Forces manifests in 10 ways, depending on the Layer that they operate:
- In the Aethereal layer, they manifest as harmony versus chaos
- In the Spatial layer, they manifest as counterclockwise (stars, galaxy) versus clockwise rotation (pulsars, quasars) 
- In the Radiant layer, they manifest as waves of light versus hot and cold particles
- In the Transformative layer, they manifest as radioactive decay or nondecay
<!-- right-hand versus left-hand spin -->
- In the Material layer, they manifest as the 3 color charges which match the 3 *gunas* of Hinduism
<!-- negative versus positive charges -->


## Organization of the 5 Layers in This Work
