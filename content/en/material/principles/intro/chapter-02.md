Each layer is divided into 2 sublayers, a higher part and a lower part. 

Sublayer | Description
--- | ---
Upper Aethereal | Has ideas
Lower Aethereal | Has thoughts
Upper Spacetime | Has metaphysical time
Lower Spacetime | Has physical time 
Upper Radiant | Has photons or qols
Lower Radiant | Has electrons or qoe
Upper Transformative | W Boson
Lower Transformative | Z Boson
Upper Material | Color Charge Quark qom 
Mid Material | Color Charge Quark qom
Lower Material | Color Charge Quark qom

<!-- Electroweak <-- Higgs  -->

 


## Organization of the 5 Layers

The principles of Material Superphysics is organized under the following headings.

n | Topic             | Aethereal | Spacetime | Radiant | Transformative | Material
