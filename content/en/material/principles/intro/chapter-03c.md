In 535 BC, Pythagoras went to Egypt to learn Egyptian Science and Cosmology. He came back with the scale `do re mi fa sol la ti`.

`Do` represents gamma or Gaia or Earth-Element which is the 1st Element now called the Strong Force.

`Re` represents things (Latin 'Re').

`Mi` represents moons (Greek Minis or Μήνης).

`Fa` represents planets (Egytian 'bearer'). This has the 2nd Element as Water or Weak Force.

`Sol` represents stars (Greek 'Sun'). This has the 3rd Element as Fire or Electromagnetism.

`La` represents galaxies (Latin 'Lac' or Milky [way]). This has the 4th Element as Air or Spacetime.

`Ti` represents the total perception (Latin 'Ti' or you). This has the 5th Element as Aether.

Johannes Kepler revived the Pythagorean system to explain the gravitation between planets and the sun as Harmonic Ratios.

Instead of using equations such as Force = Mass * Acceleration, Kepler's system uses ratios. For example, a starting ratio for a mass is:

```
Mass_State1 : Location 1
```

To move it to location 2:

```
(Material Contact Force + Mass_State1) : Location 2
```

Here, matter-ial forces can be added to matter to change their location in space because both are of the Earth-Element (Strong Force).

In effect, the addition of the Material force on Mass_State1 caused it to change state, so that:

```
Mass_State2 : Location 2
```

But this is not true for Electromagnetic Forces (Fire Element)

For example, the following does not work:

```
(Heat + Mass) : Location 2
```

Instead, to move the mass to location 2 as `F = Q(vB)`,

```
Magnetic Force + (charged object (magnetic speed : field)) : Location 2
```

Note how this has more factors than matter-induced movement. Those factors have to be manipulated in a more precise way to change the state of the mass or object to move it where we want.

Therefore, to move the mass with Aethereal Force (5th Element) which uses the least physical energy:

```
Aethereal Force + (mass (...) : (charged object (...)) : Location 2
```

Where `...` represents the factors that we are still trying to discover.

This is the foundation of anti-gravity as done by the ancient Egyptians.

Kepler's system was very complicated, because being German like Hegel and Kant, he over-explained it as to be totally confusing.

Newton solved it with a dumbed-down system of F = ma. It removes the factors and makes it understandable to all. 

But by doing so, it also removed the possibility of magenetic and aethereal movement.

We aim to simplify Kepler's system to make it understandable while retaining its potential for aethereal movement, as well as more improved magnetic ones.
