Physics was created from the lowest Material layer (Strong Force), working its way up to the Transformative (Weak Force) and then to the Radiant (Electromagnetic).

Superphysics is created from the top Aethereal layer working downwards to the Material. This allows us to see all particles and forces from the highest viewpoint and reclassify them in a proper and intuitive way.

Instead of the messy classification of Fermions, Bosons, Hadrons, Baryons, Mesons, Leptons, etc., we use base the name on the Layer that the particle or force operates from. 

Everything in the universe is either a Force or a Substance, metaphysically as a desire and the actual idea that is desired. 
- Instead of desire, we use force 
- Instead of substance, we use quanta

Layer | Superphysics Force Name | Physics 'Boson' Name
--- | --- | ---
Aethereal | Foa | ?
Spatial | Fost | Graviton
Radiant | Fol  | Photon
Transformative | Fot | W Z Bosons
Material | Fom | Gluons

Layer | Superphysics Quanta Name | Physics Particle Name
--- | --- | ---
Aethereal | Qoa | ? 
Spatial | Qost | ?
Radiant | Qor  | Electron
Transformative | Fot | Neutron
Material | Qom | Quark

The differences between the Physics model and the Superphysics one are:
- Neutrons are an essential substance or quanta even if it is not a fundamental particle in Physics
- The Superphysics model extends all the way to the Aethereal
