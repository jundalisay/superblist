Modern Physics was created from the lowest Material layer (Strong Force), working its way upwards to the Transformative (Weak Force) and then to the Radiant (Electromagnetic).

In contrast, Superphysics is created from the top Aethereal layer working downwards to the Material. This allows us to see all particles and forces from the highest viewpoint and reclassify them in a proper and intuitive way.

Instead of the messy classification of Fermions, Bosons, Hadrons, Baryons, Mesons, Leptons, etc., we use base the name on the Layer that the particle or force operates from. 

Everything in the universe is either a Medium or a Substance.
- Medium is where force works through.
- Substance is the discrete identity that reacts to the force. 

All forces such as gravity, electromagnetism, contact forces are manifestations of the 2 Forces, which are aethereal in nature. We use:
- the word medium to denote the medium
- the word quantum to denote substance

<!-- , metaphysically as a desire and the actual idea that is desired. 
- Instead of desire, we use **force**
- Instead of substance, we use **quanta** -->


{{< q a="Descartes" c="Meditations Simplified, Part 6">}}
Sensory ideas must be produced by some substance other than me. This substance actually has all the reality that is represented in the ideas that it produces. This substance is either a body, or it is God.

{{< q a="Descartes" c="Meditations Simplified, Part 3">}}
I think of myself as a thing that thinks and is not extended. I also think of the stone as a thing that is extended and does not think. The two conceptions differ enormously. But they seem to have the classification ‘substance’ in common.

These media and quanta are then applied to the 5 Layers.

Layer | Superphysics Medium | Common Name | Physics 'Boson' Name
--- | --- | --- | ---
Aethereal | moa (Medium of Aether) | Impact | ?
Spatial | most (Medium of Space-Time) | Gravity | Graviton
Radiant | mor (Medium of Radiance) | Brightness | Photon
Transformative | mot (Medium of Transformation) | Changeability | W Z Bosons
Material | mom (Medium of Matter) | Rigidity | Gluons

Layer | Superphysics Quanta | Common Name
--- | --- | --- 
Aethereal | qoa (Quantum of Aether) | ?
Spatial | qost (Quantum of Space-Time) | Graviton?
Radiant | qor (Quantum of Radiance) | Electron 
Transformative | qot (Quantum of Transformation) | Neutron 
Material | qom (Quantum of Matter) | Proton 

The differences between the Physics model and the Superphysics one are:
- Neutrons and Protons are an essential substance or quanta even if it is not a fundamental particle in Physics
- In Superphysics, quark 'colors' are merely representations of the 3 Influences of Crudifying, Transforming, and Subtlifying   
- The Superphysics model extends all the way to the Aethereal
