The universe is a reality that is made up of 5 Layers that are completely integrated with each other. 

An analogy is a Photoshop image which is made up layers that are on top of each other. 

{{< img src="/graphics/super/layers.jpg" alt="Layers in an image" cap="Reality is made up of 5 Layers which the ancients called the 5 Elements" >}}

These layers were known to the ancient Greeks, Hindus, and Chinese as the 5 Elements. Currently, Modern Physics only knows 3 of the 5 as:

1. Strong Force
2. Weak Force 
3. Electromagnetism 

The 4th force as gravity is not yet fully understood by Modern Physics. To understand why, we have to look into the nature of Western thinking.

 <!-- Such a concept is absent in science because science came from the Western civilization which is really just the Roman Empire.  -->

## The Western Limitation

Modern Physics came from Isaac Newton who came up with classical mechanics to explain why 17th-century things move. For example, a falling apple immediately includes 3 of the 5 forces:

1. Strong force to keep the apple's identity
2. Gravitational force to make the apple fall
3. Electromagnetism for the apple to repel the Earth and not fall through the soil  

<!-- > *Newton's Principia is written in Latin, the language of the Roman Empire -->

Newton was very good at math and so he naturally had little knowledge of metaphysics*. This is because math deals with counting discrete identities and particles such as `1`, `2`, `3` whereas metaphysics deals with abstract waves such as the feelings of `peace`, `prosperity`, and `love`.  

{{< q a="Socrates" c="The Republic by Plato Simplified, Book 7" >}}
Surely the skilled mathematician is not a dialectician.
{{< /q>}}

This is why Newton kept on studying the Bible and making predictions from it, as if they could ever come true. His ignorance of metaphysics is why he could not find the cause of gravity.

{{< q a="Newton" c="Principia Mathematica Book 3, General Scholium" >}}
But I have not been able to discover the cause of gravity from phenomena. I have no hypotheses because hypotheses have no place in experimental philosophy.. To me, it is enough that gravity exists and that it accounts for all the motions of the the celestial bodies, and of our sea. 
{{< /q >}}

The knowledge of metaphysics can be revealed by knowing the nature of the aether just as that of physics can be known revealing the nature of matter. 
- The aether acts as waves
  - This is good for music and therefore art and philosophy
- Matter acts as particles
  - This is good for quantifying and therefore math and engineering

The operations of the mind for math and philosophy are very different. A good philosopher often is bad at math, just as an excellent mathematician is awful at philosophy. 

Superphysicists are generally philosophers first, who use data science and computers to augment any deficiency in  mathematics or memorization. 

Modern Physics therefore began with a matter-first paradigm and then jumping to the realm of electromagnetism. Over time, physicists classified forces into four:

1. Strong
2. Weak
3. Electromagnetism
4. Gravitation

Physicists are dumbfounded at the mysteries of gravitation which has very different dynamics from Matter or Electromagnetism. 

Einstein's General Relativity (GR) was supposed to explain it. Like Newton, Einstein was good at math, able to create field equations to explain the structure of spacetime. However, like Newton, he was ignorant of metaphysics and so his [field equations are unsolvable](https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2019/12/04/this-is-why-scientists-will-never-exactly-solve-general-relativity/).

The limitations of Modern Physics are therefore caused by the ignorance of metaphysics, something that the West inherited from the Romans who assigned natural phenomena to the actions of gods and goddesses. 

<!--  The problem is that they don't know that GR is a sophistry that traps Physics* within  Electromagnetism and away from gravitation. 

> *The concept of quantum fields comes from magnetic fields which is a property of the Electromagnetic force and not the gravitational force which works on relationships between discrete identities -->


<!-- > *We break down Einstein's sophistry set by step by going through his logic in his book [Relativity](/research/einstein/relativity/section-02)  -->


## The Asian Model

Superphysics breaks through the limitations of Modern Physics by adding into it the proper metaphysics from the ancient Greeks, Indians, and Chinese who all follow a five-force or five-layer model: 


Greeks (Timaeus) | Hindus | Chinese | Shape
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Aether (dodecahedron)  | Akasha | 水 still water | ![](/graphics/physics/dode.gif)
Wind (octahedron) | Vayu | 木 moving wood | ![](/graphics/physics/octa.gif)
Fire (tetrahedron) | Tejas | 火 radiant fire | ![](/graphics/physics/tetra.gif)
Water (icosahedron) | Jala | 土 transforming earth | ![](/graphics/physics/icos.gif)
Earth (cube) | Pritvi | 金 solid metal | ![](/graphics/physics/cube.gif)


We then unify all the understandings of the Romans, Greeks, Hindus, and Chinese under our 5-Layers model:

Rank | Name | Greek-Hindu | Chinese | Physics Force | Superphysics Force | Force Carrier | Resulting particles in Superphysics | Pythagorean Note
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- 
0 | Metaphysical | Metaphysics | ? | Pseudo-science | Yang Yin | Soul | The One, Brahma, Tao | Octave
1 | Aethereal | Aether, Akasha | 水 (still water) | Pseudo-science | Creative force | Thought (effective qoa or idea) | qoa or quantum of aether | La 
2 | Spatial | Air, Vayu | 木 (moving wood) | Gravity | Gravity | Schwarzchild Radius (qost or graviton) | qost or quantum of spacetime | Sol
3 | Radiant | Fire, Tejas | 火 (expanding fire) | Electromagnetism | Male-Female force | Photon (qol) | qoe, qol | Mi
4 | Transformative | Water, Jala | 土 (changing earth) | Weak | Transformative force | W Z Bosons (qor) | qor or quantum of radioactivity | Re
5 | Material | Earth, Pritvi | 金 (solid metal) | Strong | Nuclear force | Gluons (effective qom) | qom (quarks) | Do


These 5 layers classify Physical Reality neatly so that it can integrate perfectly with Metaphysical Reality which is made up of life, soul and identity. 

  <!-- mysteries of quantum physics (which is based on the radiant or electromagnetic layer) by extending human knowledge onto the higher gravitational (spatial) and aethereal layers.  -->

{{< q a="Krishna" c="Bhagavad Gita" >}}
My manifest form is made up of:
1. Earth
2. Water
3. Flame
4. Air
5. Aether
6. Life
7. Mind (Soul)
8. Individuality (Identity)

These are my lower Nature. Learn my higher Nature that produces this Universe by its principle of life.

These layers are immediately implementable in healthcare. For example, Ayurveda has the three doshas (three layers) and Traditional Chinese medicine has wu xing (five layers). 

Western medicine only works on the material layer which is the crudest of the five. This explains why Western medicine has no solution to mental problems, which reside in the aethereal and spatial layers, such as ADHD, bipolar disorder, addiction, mass shootings, and terrorism. 

Instead, Western medicine is very good at material health problems that can be cured by physical surgery or masked by chemical medicines. 



### The Octave vs the Pentatonic Scale

Each of these layers has a sound which represents the wave of that layer. This manifests as the five-tones of the Chinese and the 'diapente' of Pythagoras, as Do Re Mi Sol La.
- Sol is the Greek Sol for the sun
- La is Greek for 'milk' which became the name of the Milky Way galaxy, as their universe

The totality of the universe, combining the physical and metaphysical, have eight tones as the octave of the Greeks and the Bagua of the Chinese.

The major tones form general shapes when they are visualized in the same way that audio is visualized by modern mp3 players. This is why Plato organized them into 5 shapes:

1.  Tetrahedron
2.  Cube
3.  Octahedron
4.  Icosahedron
5.  Dodecahedron

{{< youtube pMK7dTU0jn0 >}}

These tones manifest as waves such as pulse. 

By checking a patient's pulse, the traditional chinese doctor checks the wave of that person through his own feelings. Likewise, the homeopath checks this wave through the electrical current that he runs through his patient. 

<!-- The Greeks on the other hand, used eight sounds to represent the five layers. Three, do-re-mi (C-D-E), are for the lower three layers, while fa-so-la-ti-do (F-G-A-B) are for the spatial and aethereal layers. C and G were common in Western Classical Music.   -->

This sound or wave system is the only way to judge and measure the aethereal layer, as well as give the complete picture of the spatial layer. This is because light and sight are useless in the invisible aethereal layer and not 100% useful in the spatial layer. 

For example, Galileo demonstrated that two objects with different weights *visually* fall to the ground at the same time, at the same speed. However, those two objects *make different sounds*. The difference of their resulting sounds then will indicate the differences in the nature of their qost, Schwarzchild radius, or graviton. 

Layer | Transition
--- | ---
Aethereal | Idea into Aethereal Wave
Spacetime | Aethereal Wave into Physical Wave
Radiant (Electromagnetism) | Physical Wave into Emitted Particles
Transformative | Emitted Particles into Matter
Material | Matter into Identity


The next post will apply the five layers to fix Einstein's Theory of General Relativity so that space travel can free itself of the shackles of light and allow both teleportation and fusion

<!-- leave ex  explain universal relativity which applies relativistic movement on the five layers. It explains how everything in the universe is interconnected.
