The interaction between gravitational signatures naturally lead to gravitational territories which represent the space of the identity. In Physics, this is known as 'gravitational fields'.

Rene Descartes described these signatures as spinning vortices, each with its own strength and direction. 

{{< q a="Descartes" c="The World, Chapter 8" >}}
When the pure aether began to be divided, its division began in one part and spread out to all its parts as equally as it could. However, this equality of division could not be perfect because the division could not spread in a straight line since there was no void. Instead, each division happened as circular motions with different centers. This is because God gave each particle a different motion.

> *Quantum physics uses fields because it arose from electromagnetism which has magnetic fields. This is not useful in Superphysics because the aether is the most superior layer and we never think that feelings or minds have fields. Instead feelings and minds have layers -- there are deep and shallow minds, feelings, and ideas. Moreover, identities have territories or personal space, i.e. We say 'this is mine'.


Each territory has parts or zones, each with different properties:

Zone | Properties
--- | ---
Inner   | has the most stability 
Middle  | protects the stability 
Outer   | has the most space 
Edge    | has highest energy levels

These 4 zones match the:
- 4 Energy Levels or Electron Shells of Electrons
- 4 orbits of solar systems 
  - Goldilicks zone
  - Large Planet zone
  - Oort Cloud
  - Stellar Halo
