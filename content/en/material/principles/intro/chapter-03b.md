The interaction between gravitational signatures naturally lead to gravitational territories which represent the space of the identity.



> *Quantum physics uses fields because it arose from electromagnetism which has magnetic fields. This is not useful in Superphysics because the aether is the most superior layer and we never think that feelings or minds have fields. Instead feelings and minds have layers -- there are deep and shallow minds, feelings, and ideas.
