## The Two Domains

In [a previous post](/material/solutions/cartesian-view), we explained the Cartesian view which saw the universe in 2 planes: 

1. Physical
2. Aethereal 

These 2 planes have 2 attributes as timespan and layer, and lead to 2 kinds of sources of motion:

1. Physical Force
2. Aetheral Effort 

The motion is then represented by the Kepler tensor made up of:

- `G` or the Gravitational Signature of the Identity
- `s` or the layer where that identity is moving, set by the Cartesian View

## The 5 Layers of Superphysics

Superphysics has 5 layers derived from the ancients. In the physical plane, these lead to 5 kinds of gravities and 5 kinds of relationalities:

Physical Layer| Gravity | Relationality or Bands | Pythagorean Tone | Independence of Time
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Aethereal | Aethereal Attraction or Repulsion | Aethereal | Ti | Insignificant
Spatial | Gravity | Gravitational | La
Radiant | Magnetism |  Lorentz Relativity | Sol | Dependent on Viewpoint
Transformative | Decay | Feynman Diagrams | Re | 
Material | Atomic bond | Contact Forces | Do, Mi | Totally Absolute or Independent of Viewpoint


In the metaphysical plane, this leads to 5 groups of motions for layers which roughly follow Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs

Metaphysical Layer | Need | Examples
--- | --- | ---
Aethereal | Spiritual | Enlightenment and Realization
Spatial | Psycho-spritual, Intellectual | Philosophy (Movement of Ideas), Theories
Radiant | Expression, Mental | Religion (Movement of Beliefs), Mental Diseases
Transformative | Social | Marriage, Elections, Complex Diseases
Material | Bodily | Price Movements, Procedures, Ordinary Diseases

In this way, the Kepler tensor can trace and predict all movements in the universe. 



## Has Relationality Baked In

According to both Kepler and Descartes, all movement is in relation to something.
- To Kepler, the movement of planets are in relation to the sun and to each other
- To Descartes, all movement of an object is in relation to itself at the former time
