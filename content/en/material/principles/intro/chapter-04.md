The 2 Forces of Positive and Negative create a duality in the physical domain just as it does in the metaphysical. In the 5 Layers, this manifests as the following:

Layer | Duality 
--- | ---
Aethereal | Unifying versus Divisive
Spatial | Clockwise versus Counterclockwise
Radiant | Male (Negative Charge in Physics) versus Female (Positive Charge in Physics)
Transformative | Symmetry versus Non-symmetry
Material | Particle versus Antiparticle
