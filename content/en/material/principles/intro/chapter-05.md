The differences between gravitational signatures create movement between identities as either:
- attraction
- repulsion
- stasis

The addition or splitting of signatures is from the Negative Force, while the resulting stability is from the Positive. 

It follows that the energy or driving force is from the Positive and Negative Forces that exert themselves through the gravitational signature.

This potential energy of an identity for change or movement is estimated by the Eagle, which is our equation for everything:

In active form, the signatures form a chain for energies that affect the movement and change of others. These movements happen in the 'Cartesian View' which are slices of spacetime.

This chain is made up of ratios between the signatures of identities, and is processed by Qualimath.
- The chain is how everything in the universe is connected.
- These ratios are the relational bands between signatures. 


## Everything is in Motion

The creation of innumerable qost-identities leads to the expansion of the universe. These identities push each other to preserve their identity. This preservation is caused by [the Law of Conservation of Idea,](/superphysics/principles/chapter-03) a concept not present in Physics nor Science.

This pushing is based on the existential principle to preserve the discreteness of identity. This principle* then leads to:
- the law of conservation of energy in the Radiant Layer
- the law of conservation of mass in the Material Layer

> *The main difference between our unification and the one done by Einstein is that Einstein uses light or Electromagnetism as the unifying medium, whereas we use the aether. 


<!-- The pushing leads to the creation and expansion of physical space, first as 2-dimensional (Pythagorean duad) and then into 3-dimensions (triad). The sequence of expansion then leads to physical time as the fourth dimension (tetrad), leading to 4-dimensional "Minkowski" spacetime to an observer. -->

This "pushing" is similar to the theory of Descartes which was destroyed by Newton:

{{< q a="Adam-Smith" c="The History of Astronomy by Adam Smith Simplified" >}}
According to Descartes, through an eternal revolution from rest to motion and motion to rest, the amount of motion in the universe was always the same. But there was no void. 

No part of matter could be moved without thrusting some other out of its place. The matter which any body pushed before it, rolled immediately backwards, to supply the place of that matter which flowed in behind it. 

This is similar to the swimming of a fish. The water, which it pushes before it, immediately rolls backwards, to supply the place of what flows in. It thus forms a vortex around the body of the fish. In the same way, the motion originally impressed by the Creator on matter produced in it an infinity of vortices, or circular streams.

The range of motions arising from the perpetual pushing is determined by the identity's gravitational signature in relation to other signatures. The relation can be within the same Layer or extend to lower Layers. For example, magnetism is affected by heat, but not by light, just as light is affected by gravity, but gravity or weight is not changed by light. 

<!-- Each layer has its potential ratio:

Layer | Ratio
--- | ---
Aethereal | E::G(idea)
Spatial | E::G(vortex)
Radiant | E=mc^2
Transformative | Feynman diagrams
Material | w=mg -->


<!-- heading = "All Movement is Sourced Internally"
Unlike Physics which says movement is sourced externally, Superphysics asserts that all movement is internal -->

<!-- Can't find a [WIMP of dark energy](https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2019/02/22/the-wimp-miracle-is-dead-as-dark-matter-experiments-come-up-empty-again/#95053e86dbc6)? That's because space isn't a thing that fills gaps between objects. Rather, it's just an effect of observation and is the same reason behind quantum non-locality.

Space-time depends totally on perception. Rather than say that it is infinite, it is more correct to call it as totally abitrary. A particle, when imposed on (since its 'spin' reflects reality), can therefore arbitrarily change its location and 'defy' gravity and locality.
 -->

<!-- In Superphysics, physical existence is made when the aether arbitrarily creates **q**uanta **o**f **s**pace**t**ime or [qost](/material/principles/part-2/chapter-02)*, which are 1-dimensional points, within itself. Each point is a discrete and unique identity filled with an arbitrary amount of qualities as potentiality. 


> *pronounced as 'kost'. This is supposed to be the graviton which will never be found, because it can only be felt since it lies in the spatial layer which is above the visible eletromagnetic layer. Nor can it be detected directly by instruments that use electromagnetism. It can only be detected by spacetime itself (as gravitational waves or vibrations which lie in the same spatial layer) or by minds and feelings (which lie in the aethereal layer above it). 
 -->


<!-- <p>It can be detected indirectly by electromagentism. For example, LIGO uses lasers to detect gravitational waves.</p> -->


<!-- However, this detection is partly sophistical because it imposes the properties of electromagentism onto the properties of spacetime. A person interpreting LIGO data will interpret gravitational waves to travel at the speed of light simply because light was used to measure it.</p>

<!-- ## Push!
Creation goes on to make the 5th, 6th, and 7th dimensions*. However, only the 4 dimensions are visible to our ordinary senses, since the 5th to 7th are metaphysical in essence. 

> *The 7 dimensions match the 7 chakra-vortices in Hinduism and is essential in Ayurveda, which we classify under [Bio Superphysics](/bio). The sequence of creation is actually in reverse. From the Creator's perspective, it starts from the 7th then goes down to the 1st dimension. But from our perspective as 'createes', it's from the 1st to the 7th.  


Thus, spacetime is created by the mere existence or popping-in of the qosts from the aether. This gives the **illusion** of movement by one qost against the other when in fact, none of them are moving. The only real movement is their appearance into reality or actuality coming from nonreality or probability. 

Descartes is correct that motion is affected by the aether, but is incorrect in saying that the aether is physical in nature as to affect planets and galaxies **directly**.  -->

<!-- In reality, the aether* is invisible and immaterial. It interacts instead with feelings and ideas since it *is* the material of feelings, ideas, and the abstract minds that contain those feelings and ideas.  

The metaphysical idea for a galaxy then is translated into an actual physical galaxy by qosts (monads, gravitons, Schwarzschild radii) of the spatial layer.
