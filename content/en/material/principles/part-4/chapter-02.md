The Transformative Layer is divided into Upper, Middle, and Lower Sublayers.

<!-- , with the Upper being made of waves, and the Lower being made up of particles. -->


Sublayer | Example | Quanta 
--- | --- | --- 
Upper | Radioactivity | Z+ Boson
Mid | Chemical reactivity | Z- Boson
Lower | Chemical changes | W Boson


<!-- The Upper Radiant is  the realm of mental space and time and is not physical. 

The Middle Spacetime allows acces to different universes, each one with different Physics. It is quasi-physical since it is the bridge between physical spacetime and the aether which is not bound by space nor time.

The Lower Spacetime is the realm that we can see. It manifests as the distance between objects on our table and that between two galaxies. It is physical since our 5 senses can clearly detect space and time.
