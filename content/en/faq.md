## Basics 

{{< r a="Asker" >}}
What is Superphysics?
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Superphysics" >}}
Superphysics is the merging of Science and Metaphysics without going into the details of either. It acts as a bridge between ancient metaphysics and modern science, as explained by Francis Bacon.
{{< /l >}}

{{< q a="Francis-Bacon" c="The Proficience And Advancement Of Learning Simplified, Book 2 Part 7" >}}
Natural science or theory is divided into physic and metaphysic.

Physic should contemplate that which is inherent in matter, and therefore transitory. Metaphysic should contemplate that which is abstracted and fixed.

Physic should handle that which supposeth in nature only a being and moving. Metaphysic should handle that which supposeth further in nature a reason, understanding, and platform.
{{< /q >}}



{{< r a="Asker" >}}
So it's pseudo-science because it has metaphysics?
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Superphysics" >}}
No. Superphysics upgrades science by adding metaphysics, similar to how Android is an upgrade of cellphones by adding installable apps.

Do we call a Samsung Android as a pseudo-Nokia 3310? 
{{< /l>}}

{{< r a="Asker" >}}
No. We call it a 'smart-phone'.
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Superphysics" >}}
Correct. We add the word 'smart.' Similarly, we add 'super' to 'physics' to set it apart. This is supported by Francis Bacon who called 'natural magic' as part of metaphysics.
{{< /l >}}

{{< q a="Francis-Bacon" c="Book 2 Part 1, The Proficience And Advancement Of Learning Simplified" >}}
Superstitious narrations of sorceries, witchcrafts, dreams, divinations, and the like, where there is an assurance and clear evidence of the fact, SHOULD NOT be excluded altogether. This is because it is not yet known in what cases and how far effects attributed to superstition do participate of natural causes. Therefore, howsoever the practice of such things is to be condemned, yet from the speculation and consideration of them, light may be taken for the further understanding of Nature.   
{{< /q >}}

{{< l a="Superphysics" >}}
**Socratic Dialectics** makes up the core of this 'super' upgrade as part of the process of data gathering, probing, and experimenting that adds the 6th sense of intuition or higher mind which Socrates called the 'higher principle'. You could say that the 5 senses detect visible particles and objects, while the 6th sense detects invisible waves and patterns. Most people only use the 5 senses. A very few use all 6 senses. Of those very few, only a handful have the intellect to connect everything. 
{{< /l >}}


{{< q a="Socrates" c="The Republic Simplified" >}}
He leaves this higher principle in pure abstraction when the lower and higher principle clash. He rouses up the third principle which is reason... The intellectual sphere has a lower part where the soul uses the shapes given by the higher part as images. Enquiries here does not go upwards to a higher principle.
{{< /q >}}


{{< r a="Asker" >}}
How is Socratic Dialectics different from Dialectics?
{{< /r >}}

<!-- hijacked dialectics and made his own version based an his own matter-based metaphysics (as 'substance'). The Germans, like Kant, Engels, Marx, and Einstein followed Aristotle.  -->


{{< l a="Superphysics" >}}
Socratic Dialectics uses timeless metaphysical truths as the quality control for logic. Its rival is Aristotlean and Marxist dialectics which uses either the ego or matter (materialism). These led have to Economic Materialism, Dialectical Materialism, Scientism, etc. 
- Economic Materialism has led to financial crises and poverty.
- Dialectical Materialism has led to Marxism and Communism. 
- Scientism has limited Physics to the 3 Elements (Strong Force, Weak Force, Electromagnetism) and has kept the 2 higner Elements (Spacetime, and Aether) out of reach, undiscovered.  As a result, humans are unable to spread themselves to Mars or even to the Moon.

The enlightened philosophers like Bacon, Hume, and Ibn-Khaldun denounced Aristotle. So you can say we are fully in the Plato-Pythagoras-Hinduism-Buddhism-Taoism camp.
{{< /l >}}

<!--  which has caused a lot of problems in the world via Marxism and Communism. The goals of Marxism of freedom and justice are very good and noble, but its underlying metaphysics is totally junk. This leads to suffering instead of goodness.

Its rival Capitalism also embraces Aristotle, as proven by Ayn Rand and the subsequent  which also caused suffering.

{{< r a="Asker" >}}
How sure are you that Superphysics can solve what Science cannot?
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Superphysics" >}}
Because we absorb all data, information, and human knowledge, even from Asia, Africa, Hinduism, Buddhism, Taoism, even human information about aliens. 

Hinduism, Buddhism, and Taoism allow other dimensions by default. Even Islam has the concept of [Jinns](/research/mohammad/quran/sura-072). This gives us a bigger data set from which we can test their own principles on our reality.

This is different from Roman philosophy which has no metaphysics to allow other dimensions. Notice how Roman gods just mirror human characteristics. The Roman mentality evolved to be Western thinking and subsequently as limited Western Science which only deal with the obvious and shallow perceptions. 
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Asker" >}}
How do you weed out junk ideas like faeries and pixie dust?
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Superphysics" >}}
By finding consistent patterns from data. The patterns are then extrapolated and interpolated to lead to predictions that can be tested in the real world. Do you have data on faeries and pixie dust?
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Asker" >}}
I don't have any. 
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Superphysics" >}}
So there's nothing to test. We reject its reality until we can test it. But unlike close-minded science that automatically rejects its possible existence, we do not deny its possibility. Perhaps they are real in another universe which has different Physics from ours, but only their aether-components cross over into the aethereal (abstract) minds of some people as aethereal ideas. Their brains then interpret those ideas as faeries and pixie dust.
{{< /l >}}

<!--  If all five continents have oral tradition of faeries and pixie dust that survive up to modern times as to be testable, then there's some reality to it. But we find that there are none, so we cross it out as untrue.

Truth is the equality of perceptions. We're after true patterns that lead to the single truth, as the cause behind an issue or problem. This single truth represents the totality of perception.  -->

{{< r a="Asker" >}}
So the consistency of people around the world (who don't talk to each other) having common, innate, abstract, aethereal, or spiritual ideas is proof of a different reality or universe or dimension above ours?
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Superphysics" >}}
Yes. All cultures have similar a belief in an afterlife or another type of reality, and of a Supreme Being that administers that reality as well as ours. We use their data to test that reality and that Being.  
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="Asker" >}}
So what have you found?
{{< /r >}}

 <!-- etc. and that  It. Parmenides calls It The One, and the Chinese call It The Tao. This is similar to the idea that Descartes and Hegel had, despite them using non-Asian techniques. -->

{{< l a="Superphysics" >}}
We found that we are actually **inside** the Supreme Being that they call God, Allah, Jehovah, Yahweh, Brahma, or whatever, and that everything inside it is generated **in real-time** through the wave function collapse in Quantum Mechanics. This is similar to how a computer can generate anything that it wants in its virtual reality. Again this is very different from the Roman or Jewish belief that the universe was pre-created, usually in 7 days.
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Asker" >}}
Ah, the real-time creation is the same idea in the movie "The Matrix".
{{< /r >}}

{{< youtube OKpHHMi3yZU >}}

{{< l a="Superphysics" >}}
Yes. It's more commonly known as theories that say that we exist in a simulation. Knowing how this simulation is sustained allows the possibility to tap into that inexhaustible creative or sustaining mechanism. 

It means existence was not meant to be suffered. In our case, we use this knowledge to solve all problems.

In the beginning, we used it to solve personal problems of others. In time, we saw everyone having the same pattern of problems. So we organized everything into Superphysics principles to make problem-solving more efficient. We saw that David Hume, in his Treatise of Human Nature, was already ahead in this regard. So we organized our principles into three (Material, Bio, and Social) to match his three books.  
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Asker" >}}
So how can that knowledge solve problems? Are you just going to be like the Hindus and solve the problem by ignoring it as an illusion?
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Superphysics" >}}
No. Superphysics aims to solve problems by striking at the root cause, which is the 'True Nature' or Dharma or Tao in every thing that leads to its discrete identity, as described by Socrates. 

A problem begins when something goes away from its True Nature, Dharma, or Tao. Most sciences just deal with effect and not cause because science is ignorant of metaphysics which is the real cause of anything in physics. The education system is supposed to help children discover their True Nature, Dharma, or Tao so that they can direct their lives towards it. But instead, it just molds them to be industrial workers (the dharma of business and industry). 

Ask anyone what the goal or purpose of their life is, and they will look at you with a blank stare. So the first step is to find the metaphysical true nature.
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Asker" >}}
Can you give an example? How would Superphysics solve a headache?
{{< /r >}}


## Bio Superphysics

{{< l a="Bio-Superphysics" >}}
By knowing the root cause of the headache. It could be diet, stress, congenital problem, bacteria, etc. The person might be doing something that is too stressful for his brain. 

Medical science deals with the headache by masking its pain (usually via Paracetamol) and not really dealing with what is causing the pain. This is to process patients faster since the body has its own natural healing mechanism. However, this also means that the headache can come back. Moreover, the doctor can only work with the data that the patient gives. 

Bio Superphysics gets all the data about the patient to find the pattern on which *layer* the cause is in. It then routes that patient to the proper specialist whether it be from Western medicine, yoga, Chinese medicine, homeopathy, etc. For chronic headache, you could try accupuncture.
{{< /l >}}

<!-- 
, on the other hand, gets not only all the data from the person to find out what the cause, but also the patterns from all the data. This is more difficult and time-consuming, but is able to give more lasting solutions.
Bio Superphysics gives the person to question himself and extract data from his habits and memory so he can find the root cause because

This technique is the original Socratic Dialectics and is actually done by Chinese medicine and Homeopathy. the Socratic-dialectical method is an upgrade of the scientific method which has a limited dataset. --> 

<!-- combines the patient's knowledge of himself with the knowledge of the doctor regarding headaches. This combined knowledge can then point to the proper headache solutions whether it be from -->

{{< r a="Asker" >}}
So you want everyone to switch to alternative medicine?
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Bio-Superphysics" >}}
No. Each [medical paradigm](/bio/principles/part-04/chapter-03) is a tool dealing with the five layers. You choose the medical paradigm for the right layer of the disease just as you use a hammer for nails and a screwdriver for screws.  It would be very ineffective to use a hammer to drive screws. 

But people often use alternative medicine for the wrong purpose and so it unfairly gets a bad reputation. 

Western medicine works best in the material layer but is awful at the mental layer. This is why the West has a lot of mental problems that lead to riots and mass shootings. 

Yoga is great at the mental layer, but terrible at the material layer. This is why India is so materially poor.
{{< /l >}}


## Social Superphysics

{{< r a="Muslim" >}}
How would Superphysics solve the Israel-Hamas conflict?
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Social-Superphysics" >}}
By writing a new law-book that unifies the Torah and the Quran. The root cause of the conflict is that:
- The Jews program their minds according to the Torah
- The Muslims program their minds according to the Quran, which denounces the Torah 

The difference in programming creates a perpetual conflict which eats up the attention and resources of the world. This is similar to how the fight between malware and anti-virus on your computer eats up resources that slows down other programs. The world has to push for such a new law-book, as the core of a one-state solution, for its own sake. 

{{< /l >}}



## Bigots

{{< r a="Boomer" >}}
But I'm a racist, materialist boomer. I don't like anything Asian and abstract like Brahma, Yin-Yang, human unity, circular economy blah blah blah. :shit: 

I want profits and wealth for myself. I drink my expensive coffee with plastic straws. I don't care about the turtles that will die from ingesting them. Sucks to be them. It's just survival of the fittest.

You are nuts to propose a one-state solution that unites Jews and Palestinians -- Muslims are terrorists! 

The universe was created for us humans. After death, there is nothing. There is no evidence of God, the afterlife, reincarnation, or karma. So I say maximize pleasure while alive!

So what if there's global warming? In the long-run, we're all dead! At least I've experienced a 5-star lifestyle. Heaven can be on earth, bought by :musical_notes: money money money in a rich man's world :musical_notes:. 
{{< /r >}}


<!--  and don't care about the consequences, even on others! Go ahead and exhaust your brain theorizing wormholes and dark matter that will never exist, or quantitative easing that either bloats the debt and shuts down governments or causes stagflation. -->


{{< l a="Superphysics" >}}
Ok boomer, so Superphysics isn't for you. We reject selfishness, vice, and the lack of virtue. You should stay in some dogmatic religion that sees itself superior, or in Modern Physics and Economics that is limited to the 5 senses. 

People who ascribe to Superphysics are open-minded and lovers of philosophy, nature, and the Supreme Entity, as explained by Socrates. These allow the 6th sense of intuition and fellow-feeling, on top of the usual math and 5-sense cognitive abilities in IQ tests.

We are targetting young people because they are the ones stuck with warmed-world destroyed by the previous generation. Notice how we use emojis and the chat format to appeal to young people. The Boomer mentality should die with the Boomer generation and not cross over to Gen Z.
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Boomer" >}}
What makes you so absolutely sure that you know the nature of the universe? What is your qualification? I have a PhD from a top Western university with dozens of peer-reviewed papers published.
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Superphysics" >}}
We've had low-level samadhi :high_brightness:, after going through the necessary rigors.
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Boomer" >}}
What's samadhi?
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Superphysics" >}}
Google it.

All we can say is "No Samadhi, No Honey" :thumbsdown: (i.e. Without samadhi, you won't get a solid understanding of how the universe is structured and generated in real-time)
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Asker" >}}
That's like when Neo in *The Matrix* movie realizing that he was in a giant computer when he saw the code running behind his reality. (I like that movie :innocent:)
{{< /r >}}

<!-- {{< l a="Superphysics" >}}
Instead of revealing the code, we try to reveal the aether in each phenomenon. 
{{< /l >}} -->

{{< r a="Muslim" >}}
What does the Superphysics symbol mean?
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Superphysics" >}}
The blue triangle represents the metapyhsical dimension. The green triangle represents the physical dimension. These go in opposite directions. 

The yellow center is perception which balances both dimensions. :sunny:

Some people get filthy rich but lose their morals, :frowning: while others are super spiritual but are dirt poor :confused:. For example, Baby-Boomers mindlessly push for GDP or ROI growth even if Nature is hitting them back with global warming caused by that very GDP and ROI from investments. 

Spiritual people, on the other hand, give donations and service, often unsustainably while creating a culture of dependence and poverty. 

Superphysics advocates a balance or a middle path.<!--  just like Buddhism advocates a middle path -->. 
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Asker" >}}
What's the gameplan of Superphysics?
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Superphysics" >}}
We need to prove that our principles are solid by demonstrating it in the real world. 

We've already proven Social Superphysics through our correct predictions both in [politics](/social/cycles/predictions) and [economics](/social/supersociology/precrisis-years). We are already testing our points-based economic system to solve the current stagflation, something that Economics has no solution for. So no worries with those. 

But we still need to prove that Bio Superphysics and Material Superphysics also work by using the aether to  increase crop yield (as 'Maximized Farming'), cure diseases, realize fusion, levitation, and teleportation (actions at a distance).
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Asker" >}}
I guess you encounter a lot of opposition from humans who think that the limited 5-sense science is perfect and superior to 6-sense science which to them is invalid pseudo-science. :sweat:
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Superphysics" >}}
Yes. This is now known as 'scientism' propagated by materialists.

For example, alternative medicines that don't pass clinical trials are not classified as medicine even if they cure some people but not all.

Moreover, the gap between experiment and useful invention is huge. For example, the principle of action-reaction can be demonstrated with a $0.10 party balloon releasing air to propel itself. But it takes a lot more effort to convert that principle into a working rocket which costs $1,000 and even more to make an Atlas rocket :rocket: worth $100m.
{{< /l >}}

<!-- This is why, until 2030, most of our work is on Social Superphysics. The work on Bio and Material Superphysics will mostly be theoretical for now, though we've done [rudimentary experiments on pre-levitation](/material/levitation) and preventing cancers from getting worse via alternative medicine. -->

{{< r a="Asker" >}}
How can we help? :heart:
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Superphysics" >}}
You can check out our [help](/help) page
{{< /l >}}

<!-- By gettings Its principles. For example, Einstein based his Relativity on Parmenides explanation of how the One is Many and All is relative. We expand this by creating the theory of Universal Relativity for Material Superphysics, as well as the Four Laws of Value for Economic Superphysics (as spnomics)    -->
