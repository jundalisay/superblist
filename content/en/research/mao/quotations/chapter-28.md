A Communist should:
- have largeness of mind
- be staunch and active
- look upon the interests of the revolution as his very life 
- subordinate his personal interests to those of the revolution
- always and everywhere adhere to principle 
- wage a tireless struggle against all incorrect ideas and actions, so as to consolidate the collective life of the Party and strengthen the ties between the Party and the masses

He should be more concerned about the Party and the masses than about any individual, and more concerned about others than about himself. Only thus can he be considered a Communist.

Every comrade must understand that the supreme test of the words and deeds of a Communist is whether they conform with the highest interests and enjoy the support of the overwhelming majority of the people.

At no time and in no circumstances should a Communist place his personal interests first; he should subordinate them to the interests of the nation and of the masses. Hence, selfishness, slacking, corruption, seeking the limelight, and so on, are most contemptible, while selflessness, working with all one's energy, whole-hearted devotion to public duty, and quiet hard work will command respect.

Communists must be ready at all times to stand up for the truth, because truth
is in the interests of the people; Communists must be ready at all times to
correct their mistakes, because mistakes are against the interests of the
people.

Communists must always go into the whys and wherefores of anything, use their own heads and carefully think over whether or not it corresponds toreality and is really well founded; on no account should they follow blindly
and encourage slavishness.

We should encourage comrades to take the interests of the whole into account. Every Party member, every branch of work, every statement and every action must proceed from the interests of the whole Party; it is absolutely impermissible to violate this principle.

Communists should set an example in being practical as well as far-sighted. For only by being practical can they fulfil the appointed tasks, and only far-sightedness can prevent them from losing their bearings in the march forward.

Communists should be the most far-sighted, the most self-sacrificing, the
most resolute, and the least prejudiced in sizing up situations, and should rely
on the majority of the masses and win their support.

Communists should set an example in study; at all times they should be
pupils of the masses as well as their teachers.

Every Communist working in the mass movements should be a friend of the
masses and not a boss over them, an indefatigable teacher and not a
bureaucratic politician.

Communists must never separate themselves from the majority of the people or neglect them by leading only a few progressive contingents in an isolated and rash advance, but must take care to forge close links between the progressive elements and the broad masses. This is what is meant by thinking
in terms of the majority.Ibid., p. 201.*

We Communists are like seeds and the people are like the soil. Wherever we
go, we must unite with the people, take root and blossom among them.

We Communists must be able to integrate ourselves with the masses in all
things. If our Party members spend their whole lives sitting indoors and never
go out to face the world and brave the storm, what good will they be to the
Chinese people? None at all, and we do not need such people as Party
members. We Communists ought to face the world and brave the storm the
great world of mass struggle and the mighty storm of mass struggle.

The exemplary vanguard role of the Communists is of vital importance. Communists in the Eighth Route and New Fourth Armies should set an example in fighting bravely, carrying out orders, observing discipline, doing political work and fostering internal unity and solidarity.

A Communist must never be opinionated or domineering, thinking that he is
good in everything while others are good in nothing; he must never shut
himself up in his little room, or brag and boast and lord it over others.

Communists must listen attentively to the views of people outside the Party and let them have their say. If what they say is right, we ought to welcome it, and we should learn from their strong points; if it is wrong, we should let them finish what they are saying and then patiently explain things to them.

The attitude of Communists towards any person who has made mistakes in his work should be one of persuasion in order to help him change and start afresh and not one of exclusion, unless he is incorrigible.

As for people who are politically backward, Communists should not slight or despise them, but should befriend them, unite with them, convince them and encourage them to go forward.
