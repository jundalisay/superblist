There are many underdeveloped creatures which have no nerve cells and behave according to their instincts only. 

Human beings possess nerve cells and nerve fibres, but they also behave according to their instincts. 

For example, very young children smile and keep their hands closed because of their instincts. They are not goaded by intellect or by any intellectual inclination in this respect.

The innumerable nerve cells in the human body can be divided into 2 types:

1. The central nervous system

This runs from the brain to the spinal cord.

2. The peripheral nervous system

This runs from the spinal cord to the skin and going within the body.

There is also a collection of nerve cells in the cranium that is made up of fat [that is, the hypothalamus]. This has a special inborn power or a vibrational speciality, which is:
- sometimes synthetic [sympathetic]
- sometimes apathetic [parasympathetic].

In Sanskrit the region across the top of the head above the ears is called snáyupet́aka “a basket of nerves”. 

A vibration from any part of the body takes one two-hundredths of a second to reach the cranium.

Suppose an insect bites your hand. The sensation will travel through your afferent nerves to the brain. Immediately an order, which will travel through the efferent nerves, will be given to remove the insect.
- “Afferent nerves” mean “sensory nerves” in Latin, saḿjiṋá nád́ii in Sanskrit
- “Efferent nerves” mean “motor nerves”, ájiṋá nád́ii in Sanskrit

The nerve cells are active and work directly in the conscious (jágrata), subconscious (svapna) and unconscious (suśupta) states of mind, although the Sanskrit and English terms for these three states are not exactly synonymous. 

When the nerves do not work properly, sometimes people experience a condition which may be described as feeling unnerved.

For example, if a person is hit on the head and the balance between their afferent and efferent nerves is lost, the person may forget everything, lose his or her discrimination and be unable to decide what to do. 

The same condition may occur after a nightmare. If a man dreams that he is being chased by a ghost and falls down and knocks his head, he may suddenly wake up covered in perspiration, suffering from the same symptoms as if he had actually been hit on the head while awake. In such a condition we say he is feeling unnerved.

Cakra is a Sanskrit term. “Plexus” is the Latin term.

These sub-glands influence and control the propensities attached to each cakra. This science is largely unknown today.
