Appendix Five
[Published in Prajina Bharati January 1985]
To The Editor
Dear Sir,
th
Only on 6 instant I could go through the letter of Revered Acarya Shri
Santoshanandaji Avadhuta appearing in Prajina Bharati for October 1984.
His letter is more amusing and interesting than that of Reverend Acarya Shri Hari
Shankarji and I feel very much obliged for this.
During your last visit to Muzaffarpur you personally gave me several copies of Prajina
Bharati of July 84 for sale. In this issue my letter addressed to the editor was published
against the comments of Revered Acarya Shri Hari Shankarji. After going through that
letter in Prajina Bharati I found it to be amended to some extent at your end and I
requested you to issue a corrigendum to it which could never be published.
So far I could know that Reverend Baba always remained very busy but never knew
that He is unapproachable even for consultation on important issues. But now it is a
revelation to me for which I am very much grateful to Revered Acarya Shri
Santoshanandaji Avadhuta.
Till now, neither the stock of Ananda Katha not my zeal to write it further had
exhausted but of course the letter of the learned and Revered Acarya ShriSantoshanandaji Avadhuta appearing in Prajina Bharati of October 84 has completely
dampened my spirit and zeal. Now, I really feel exhausted with the result I have totally
stopped writing Ananda Katha any further. Thanks to revered acaryaji.
This led me to decide finally to request you most sincerely not to publish Ananda Katha
th
any further. Further to this, I am to request you that the rest of my manuscript of 14
th
and 15 installments of Ananda Katha should be returned to me urgently and without
fail. Even if some portion of the manuscript of Ananda Katha has been sent to the
press, it should be taken back and returned to me without second thought. I shall be
thankful to your this kindness. My decision on this is unchangeable and unalterable at
no cost I would like any further publication Ananda Katha.
You know it for certain that subject matter of Ananda Katha always remained sacred
and pious treasure for me which I never thought of revealing to the world and what to
talk of writing about it at all. But your persistent and repeated request compelled me to
write Ananda Katha and publish it.
If possible kindly publish the Hindi translation of this letter in Ananda Yuga also. It is not
possible for me to translate it now, and so kindly take trouble of getting it done at your
end, for which I will remain obliged.
With your permission I also take the latitude of expressing my heartfelt gratitude,
feelings and thanks in abundance to the revered critics of Ananda Katha and finally bid
them good bye through your esteemed journal.
Thanking you once more.
Yours faithfully
Nagina
