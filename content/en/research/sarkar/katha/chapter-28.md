It was the 12th month of my leave, yet there was no response to my appeal.

While in the village in the fourth week of December 1955 I decided that I would extend my leave no further and shall send my resignation. I decided this mentally and did not tell this to any member of my family. I thought that I should inform my family after my resignation was accepted.

My leave finished on 6 January 1956. I decided to resign thereafter. On the
fourth day of taking this decision I received an inland letter. I could not guess who had
sent it but when I opened it I found that it was from Baba. The letter was in English
language. Today that letter is not with me but I remember fully its language. I shall try
to reproduce it here.
“Your decision of resignation is premature. You must join your duty
urgently and I will give you everything. In case you fail to reconcile in joining to
your present post, you take it as my order and must report for duty immediately.”
I was surprised to note that Baba had written the letter the same day as I had
mentally resolved that I would extend my leave no longer and will resign from service.
th
Now there was no other course open for me and when my leave was over on the 6
January 1956 I rejoined my duty.
Great is the liila of omniscient Baba and wonderful are his methods of doing
favour. Sitting in a village hundreds of miles away I mentally decide something and
Baba reflects it then and there. This added one more link to the chain of my faith. Thus
1955 was over with the Grace of Baba
Salutations to Baba who loves his devotees
Following the instructions of Baba I rejoined my duty immediately on the expiry
of my leave. However the whole of 1956 and 1957 up to August was a period of great
turmoil for me. During this brief period of one year and eight months I was transferred
to seven places. My wife was not keeping good health these days. I had to look after
four children. I had to run after the doctors all the time. As there was no other
convenient place, the family had to be kept with me.
Those who have experience of government service and frequent transfers will
be able to understand my plight very well. In spite of these troubles Baba’s grace was
always with me. Whenever I had to go for however a small period, I got good name and
reputation though Baba’s grace. Strange was that period, on the one hand the difficult
problems of service, the rising and unassailable mountains of economic and
psychological problems and on the other hand good name fame and reputation Great
is the Liila of Baba.
POSTED TO MUZZAFARPUR
After resuming work in Patna on 7th January 1956, I was posted to Muzaffarpur.This was a posting to my liking.
th
I assumed my duties at Muzaffarpur on 17 January 1956. After I became
somewhat free from official work I came to know that my childhood friends Acarya
Vishwanathji was also there. I therefore went to see him. From him I came to know that
Acarya Shri Kishanji and Shri Prem Bahadur Mathur were also there. I was also
informed that the Dharma Cakra was held in the bungalow of Shri Prem Bahadurji.
In the Dharma Cakra I got the opportunity to meet all the Margiis brothers. Here
I came to know that on the New Years' eve Baba’s vanii had come which was like this:
“The long neglected humanity has awakened today. This awakening of
theirs will usher in a new chapter in human history. You are the first messengers
of that still to arrive tradition”
Anandamurti 1.1.1956
I read and re-read this message and tried to understand its significance. The
vanii appeared to me to be a fragment with great significance. In those days, the so-
called civilized society looked down upon those who believed in the divinity of human
beings and wanted to lead a spiritual life. Their indifference became intolerable to Baba
and He indicated to His disciples through this blissful message that the divinity of
humanity is now fully bestirred. This will certainly open a new chapter in the history of
human progress and those who have tried to follow his path will certainly be regarded
as the harbingers of that new Age. I this found great significance in the vanii of Baba.
In such period I received a letter from my younger brother Radhakantji that the
basis of his faith had completely been broke after hearing all about Ananda Marga
philosophy and he had not yet got any new faith. He started feeling emptiness in his
daily routine of life and wanted to take initiation as early as possible. He was these
days posted at Siwan and there was no acarya either there or near about. I informed
him through letter that he should come to Muzaffarpur, where arrangements will be
made for his initiation.
Muzaffarpur at that time was most fortunate through Baba’s grace. There were
many acaryas here. On receipt of my letter he came to me at about eight in the night
and wanted to return within the next two hours. He had little time and I could hardly
manage to get into contact with an acarya in that short period. Therefore I had to give
him initiation. This was the second occasion for me to initiate anyone. My first
opportunity was to my mother.
Now after office work I had only two functions. First to run about for doctors and
second Marga work.
Salutation to BABA the Lord of the Gods and the Supreme
Divine
PATNA DMC 1956
Thus while in Muzaffarpur, in the minds of Margii brothers, my own troubled
personal life had an easy flow. Those days pracar was going strong throughout Bihar.
Those in Patna were doing Marga work with great sincerity and speed. Many
individuals came within the fold of the Marga.
DMC was arranged in Patna and Baba was to arrive on the full-moon day of the
month of Chaitra on Jamal Road in Patna. Everyone in the state of Bihar was informedabout the arrival time of Baba and the place and timing of the DMC. The Margiis of
Muzaffarpur also received this information. All were happy and began to plan going to
Patna. I was in two minds on account of my domestic troubles whether I should go or
not. Meanwhile the acaryaji from Patna told me by telephone that I must attend. I was
already desirous of going to Patna.
The Instructions from this acarya strengthened my resolve and I surrendered all
my domestic works at the lotus feet of Baba and started for Patna. There I had the
good fortune of having Baba darshan and also had the good luck to do my sastaunga
pranam at His feet. Baba enquired about my family with great affection and I was
overwhelmed with gratitude. I was so much overwhelmed with emotion that time that I
could not utter a word.
Then I recalled that a big crowd of persons desirous of Baba’s darshan was
waiting outside. Therefore unwillingly I began to control my desire to remain at His lotus
feet and again did my sastaunga pranam and went out of the room. I later was again
able to have the darshan of His Lotus Feet and began to enjoy the subtle vibrations of
spiritual waves. The whole day was spent in these vibrations. In the evening, again I
had the Baba’s darshan at the time of the DMC. Baba looked divine and superb during
the DMC. He was irresistibly attractive, justifying those lines of the great poet, Tulsidas:
“Do see, He is worth seeing”.
I continued to lose myself in this divine sight. The subject of the
discourse was “Bliss and Pleasure”. The subject was extremely good and easy
to understand. The devotees were drinking His nectar-like words from their ears
and drinking His divine beauty with their eyes at the same time. Blessed was that
hour of the DMC.
THE REJECTION OF MY SECOND APPEAL
Doing these days my second appeal was rejected in April. I felt very sad to
learn about this. I do not know why I did not feel such pain even when I was first
demoted or when my first appeal was rejected.
In this state of mind I wrote a letter to Baba, the substance of which was
whether the samskaras were so strong that guru and God were both helpless before
their power? If this is so, then that is why people forget the guru and God and begin to
give more importance to karma and samskaras. Kindly do not allow so much
importance to gain ground, otherwise humanity will repeat its mistakes again. Baba
sent me a reply, which is highly educative, and encouraging and which redressed my
mental torture. It was like this:
“Samskaras cannot be stronger than Cosmic Consciousness. When unit
consciousness start its march towards the Supreme Self – the Cosmic
Consciousness, it advances through fight against avidya and bhoga of its
prarabdha. Its march is the march of a solider undaunted and unbaffled. It gets
the final rest when crowned with victory – the feeling of oneness with Him,
earned by the heroic spirit both in the inner and outer, spheres of life “
Anandamurti
27.4.56After reading Baba’s letter I again became active and optimistic and became
involved in my job and in my work of the Marga. A few days after the receipt of this
letter, Baba’s Ananda Vanii for the Ananda Purnima of 1956 also came which said:
“Every sadhaka (aspirant) is a soldier. The symbols of their
progress are the hurts received from thorns by the march on the difficult path.
Their victory is the collective welfare of the world.”
Anandamurti
Ananda Purnima 1956
It is not easy to grasp fully the significance of Revered Baba’s messages. Even
so I give below what I understood of the above message.
The life of a sadhaka like that of a soldier is really full of difficulties and pains.
Sadhana is a process to rise above pains and pleasure. Therefore a good Sadhaka
alone can be a good soldier. The soldier of a sadhaka advances smilingly on the most
difficult terrain as he fights against all types of odds. Difficulties are only signposts of
his success and are good indications of his progress. A good soldier is always thinking
of the collective welfare and with this object in view, he advances further. Surely
success will come to such a soldier. This message of Baba encouraged all the
sadhakas immensely. Without courage neither a soldier nor a sadhaka can progress
forward. By the middle of 1956, immorality was on the increase, hence this message of
Baba’s not only encouraged sadhakas to lead a moral life, but also gave them strength
to fight immorality. Baba’s message was timely.
MY POSTING TO DALMIANAGAR
But after a few days, such was Baba’s will, that my contacts with Margii
brothers became less and less. I was transferred to Dalmianagar in the first week of
June. There the problems were so constant that I was busy in tackling them. In this
new place, my wife’s health deteriorated further, and now and then I had to rush to
Patna with her. I had informed Baba about this through a letter. Even so, now and then
I did manage to take some time for Marga work. But success in this work at this time
was negligible. There were so many problems that I wrote to Baba that I was thinking
to ask for a transfer and asked for His advice.
There came a message from Him that I have to correct the whole situation from
that place. I said I would not take any decisive step so long as the department does not
fix a definite policy for Dalmianagar. It was under the jurisdiction of the Superintendent
at Gaya. He was very simple Margii and was very scared of the atmosphere at
Dalmianagar. Officers of my department regarded Dalmianagar as a black hole in
those days, which would darken my reputation.
Anyway, keeping Baba foremost in my thoughts, I started my work. Meanwhile,
our department head thought of visiting the city on tour, and he gave me five minutes to
discuss the situation of Dalmianagar at a meeting at eight in the morning. I reached the
Circuit House of Gaya at the appointed time.
At eight I presented myself before my head. I remembered Baba and began to
talk about the administration at Dalmianagar. I had only mentioned a few things and my
five minutes were over and therefore I stopped. When my boss enquired as to why I
had stopped, I pointed out that my time was over. He asked me to resume. Again I
remembered Baba. During this discussion, when some messenger entered from
another officer, my boss felt very annoyed. There were others waiting for consultation,
but he did not heed this. Even so, it was good of my boss that he started to agree withme.
That day, five minutes extended into five hours. My discussion with this boss for
such a long time was a mater of wonder. My departmental colleagues or even very
senior officers used to get hardly ten minutes with him. All this was possible only
through Baba’s grace. At the end of the discussion, my boss enquired about my
personal well being. I told him that you have put me from frying pan into the fire and
now are enquiring about my welfare. I was happy at Muzaffarpur and you transferred
me within 6 months to Dalmianagar. He said that the chaos there forced me to put you
to this inconvenience. Then he enquired as to how be could help me now?
I said, “ Excuse me Sir, I do not rely on help from man. Man himself is
miserable. What help can be one man render to another man?”
As I said this be got up from his chair and embraced me and said, “ I wish I
could have this much mental strength in me”.
We were discussing matters in English I have therefore recorded his words as
such. He told me that at one time, he had also been initiated into Ananda Marga but be
could not do sadhana properly. I advised him to meet has acarya again After his return
from Gaya, whenever my departmental head would see a report from some senior
officer, he would ask what is the report on Nagina on this subject? And after seeing my
views, he would reject others and agree with me.
Now I was asked to attend a conference connected with Dalmianagar, on behalf
of my department. Everyone was wondering as to what Nagina has done to him in
these five hours that he would reject every ones’ views and accent mine.
Just within a few months of our meeting, this gentlemen sought retirement. I
was all along feeling that Baba was helping me at every step and where my intellect
failed he gave me new ideas was it not the grace of Baba that I could continue
discussion with this temperamental and snobbish man for five hours.
My days continued to pass in this manner so I tried to solve the departmental
problems there. Meanwhile my economic condition continued to deteriorate due to the
illness of my wife. Now I had no other recourse except to inform Baba about my
personal problems. Baba letter was received quickly. The letter was as follows:
“Dear Nagina,
The reason of your mental agonies and family trouble is that
you are careless in money matters. You should therefore give more stress to
aparigraha. Think a thousand times before you spend a single pie”.
With my love to you
Your well-wisher
Anandamurti

I was very much worried to read Baba’s letter was true to the last syllable. But
would it be possible for me to follow the spirit of these instructions?
I was also helpless before my nature. But how was I to ignore it? Baba gave me
the heart and mentality of a king and means of a beggar. Now how to bring balance
between these two? Baba had correctly written that this was the cause of my painful
career.Now I am in the evening of my life and when I look back I find that at every
stage I have passed through great economic problems. It appears that the rest of my
life will also he spent amidst economic problems by Baba’s grace. Why should it not be
so? Baba has said in his message that “suffering is your asset'’. Although I remember
Baba very much when I am in trouble, but when troubles came in succession, whether
they are regarding material, mental or spiritual matters, they do drag the mind in
crudeness. This makes one uncivilized, hard, pessimistic and angry. My prayer it that
Baba may protect me from this crudity.
In Mithilii the beautiful poetry of the poet Vidyapati is very popular and the
following song of his is sung by all with great emotion when one is passing through
dark days of life:
“Kakhan haraba dukho mor he bholanath?”
O Lord Shiva, when will you remove my sufferings?
Now in the evening of my life
I recite this song with every beat
Of my heart before Baba
Oh Lord take away the
Crudity of my mind.
I know none else except you.
I surrender to you.
Spiritualist may take pity on my condition! But those engrossed in the world will
never understand my condition. Struggle is Sadhana. Therefore, though in poverty, I
began to make efforts to somehow meet with my difficult situations. The only support
was the blessings received from Baba in his letter. Whenever I felt disturbed I would
reread the letters received from Baba. This would give me some cordage and I would
again plunge into work.
Thus, by the month of September all the problems of the new place were sorted
out. Now, I was feeling restless there in the absence of the atmosphere of Marga.
Therefore, one evening while alone began to pray to Baba that my work there was over
and now let me be transferred to a place where I can get Margii atmosphere. I would
be able to forget my worries amidst Margii brothers.
POSTED BACK TO MUZAFFARPUR
Baba heard my ardent prayer and I was surprised when the next day at 4 p.m.
in the afternoon, my superior officer from Patna told me on the telephone that another
officer was being posted at Dalmianagar, and he wanted to know whether I would like
to be posted back to Muzaffarpur. He communicated my desire to my boss and within
two days orders came for my transfer to Muzaffarpur: I reached Muzaffarpur in the first
week of October.
Great is the Lord, and great are His ways of giving Grace. First the web of
problems would torture the mind and then his kindness would bring peace and
tranquillity Great is my Baba that he gives the taste of the bitter and the sweet in such
harmonious succession.
Even after coming to Muzaffarpur, my family problems continued but I was in
the midst of Margii brothers and atmosphere, therefore my mind continued to flow
towards spirituality. Even so hard realities would sometime strike me harshly. In such astate of mind, I once thought that I should take this matter of my reversion to a court of
law. My well-wishers in the department also had the same viewpoint. The problem was
that those who were junior to me once, had become my bosses and it was hard to keep
contact with them. It was to their credit that they respected me, even so I felt very much
my own degradation. This was due to my human weakness.
Now it appeared to me as if I had submitted to injustice and therefore I began to
curse myself for it. When I consulted my well-wishers in the department I would think of
challenging them in a court of law. But at this time that portion of my mind that was
under the influence of vidya and was devoted to the lotus feet of Baba, felt determined
as to why should I not consult Baba in this regard and then proceed further accordingly.
I therefore, wrote a letter to Baba on this subject in the month of November and began
to wait for his instructions. Soon came Baba’s reply like this:
GURU
STRICTLY PRIVATE
Jamalpur 26.11.56
Nagina,
Do not file any suit. Just obey the orders of your departmental
authorities and acquire experience from the circumstances created thereby. This
experience will be of immense value, more valuable then the post of
superintendent. At that time you will realise that such a course was not at all an
act of surrender before injustice – it is what may be correctly defined as to bow
down for lighting the weapon.
Anandamurti 26.11.56
After receiving this letter from Baba I tried that I should forget this sorrowful
chapter of life altogether although it took lot of time to do so. I was always conscious
that I may drive out the memory of this event from my memory and that is what
happened after sometime through Baba’s Grace.
