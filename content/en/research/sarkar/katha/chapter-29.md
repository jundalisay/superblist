Thus time continued to pass taking worldly pain and spiritual bliss in its stride and the expansion of Marga activities continued. Now, we started thinking of calling Baba to Muzaffarpur. So far DMC had taken place in Jamalpur, Monghyr, Bhagalpur
and Patna only. Thus 1956 came to an end and 1957 began. We celebrated the New
Year. 

Baba’s Vanii for the occasion was like this:

“Those who have collected by taking the resolve of marching together the obstacles of the path cannot obstruct them. Those who are planning to conquer the world and marching to the tune of victory, their speed cannot be marred by
the suspicious sight of cowardish thoughts. 

Oh human beings, you advance forward. Your only language should be the speed towards progress.”
Anandamurti 1.1.1957
Baba encouraged the sadhakas by this powerful message and we were
reminded of ‘Samgachhadhvam....’ mantra. This mantra is not only to be recited before
the dharmacakra, but it will have to be put in to action with all sincerity. Although the
path may be full of thorns, but sadhakas who resolve to march together – will not be
obstructed by these difficulties. When a sadhaka attains perfection he sees the whole
world like a small fruit in the palm of His hand.
The sadhana of Ananda Marga is a sadhana to conquer the world and every
sadhaka has to advance merrily singing and playing the tune of victory. Suspicions
weaken the mind and such people will see thing in pessimistic way but no one can stop
the attainment of progress. Baba has not only warned the sadhakas but the whole
mankind that they should march shed with the song of victory in their lips. Baba’s
encouraging message was most timely. As many selfish, unprincipled, so-called
leaders had started viewing the progress of Ananda Marga with suspicion.
MUZAFFARPUR DMC 1957 AND MY PROMOTION
On the first of January 1957, all the Margiis of Muzzafarpur decided that Baba
should be requested to come there to bless us all and conduct DMC. Our request was
dispatched to Baba through a special messenger and we were waiting anxiously for
baba to send His acceptance of our request.
rd
Meanwhile on 3 January 1957, I was informed by phone from the office of my
departmental head in Patna, that I had been promoted and that I have been posted in
the head office at Danapur.
I received this information on the same day and almost at the same time that
two years before on 3rd January 1955, I had received the information of my demotion. I
th
was relieved of my duty on 7 January 1957 to join my new post in the head office.
Baba thus completed two years of my eventful career.
As this was going Baba’s acceptance for DMC at Muzaffarpur also arrived. The
th
th
time for DMC and Baba’s arrival was between 27 January1957 to 29 January. On
th
the 15 January I was to take over my new post in the head office and I was sorry that Iwould not be able to devote time for the preparation of the DMC.
At that time the most prominent workers at Muzaffarpur were Acarya Kishanji,
Acarya Prem Bahadurji, Acarya Vishwanathji Sakaldeoji, Gaunga Sharanji and such
other respected persons. I consulted them all and I was allowed to join duties on 15
January 1957 and asked to come to Muzaffarpur a day earlier than the DMC.
th
th
I left my family at Muzaffarpur went and joined my duties on 15 January and
th
returned to Muzaffarpur on the night of the 25 January and engaged myself in the
work of helping to organise the DMC.
Baba arrived by train. There was a big welcoming crowd of Margii brothers and
sisters at the railway station. As the train steamed in the whole atmosphere vibrated
with the sound of ‘Ananda Marga Amar Hey’ (‘Ananda Marga is Immortal’) and ‘Shrii
Shrii Anandamurtiji ki Jai’. Every Margii was caught by a wonderful wave. Someone
was weeping another was vibrating with songs and some one lost all awareness of the
body.
Among those who had come was Bindeshwariji who was dancing with great
devotion, and singing. While dancing he lost all consciousness of his body Shrii Ram
Khelavanji and other members of his family were looking after him. No-one remained
untouched by these devotional vibrations. I was standing in one corner looking at all
the devotees.
Arrangements had ben made for Baba to stay in the bungalow of Acarya Prem
Bahadur Mathur. Therefore he and Acarya Kishanji took Baba in his car to the house.
The rest of the devotees started walking towards this house dancing and singing with
devotion. They looked like the waves of the ocean rolling towards the shore. I had the
responsibility to take those devotees from Jamalpur who had come with Baba to the
place where they were to stay in my car.
The then General Secretary of the Marga, Shri P.K. Chatterjee, had also come
along with Baba. I told him that I wanted to take Baba to my residence for some time.
Though it would mean some trouble for Baba, but my house would be purified by His
presence and my family would feel blessed. He said that he would certainly put my
request before Baba. He did so and then called me in.
BABA VISITS MY HOUSE
My request to Baba to visit my house was supported by the General Secretary,
and Baba agreed to come for sometime. He was to come by noon and I was ready with
a car in advance. Baba came out at the fixed time and sat in the car, and I drove Baba
to my residence.
Every member of my family and myself got the opportunity to do our sastaunga
pranam before Baba. I was so flooded with emotion due to the immense pleasure, that
tears began to flow from my eyes and my voice was choked. I placed some fruits and
sweets before Baba but He was not prepared to eat anything. My wife was standing
with a glass of water in her hands. With great persistence, I took one rasgulla up to His
mouth. Baba took a very small bite and we were all highly pleased. Then Baba said,
“Enough”, and took the glass of water from my wife’s hand. The rest of the fruits and
sweets we ate as prasad.
Baba sat for sometime and talked with the children and then got ready to leave.
All of us did our sastaunga pranam again and then I took Him to the residence ofGaunga Sharanji which was close by. Shrii Gaunga Sharanji was standing ready to
welcome Baba. He took Baba to his drawing room. Baba stayed there for sometime
and then left for Prem Bahadurji’s bungalow.
While returning from Gaunga Sharanji’s house I asked Baba why non-Margiis
were not allowed in the DMC.
Baba said, “If some non-Margii would have an evil thought in the DMC about
me, nature rebounds this immediately even without my wishing it, and he might be
harmed. This is the reason why non-Margiis are not allowed in DMC.”
Baba gave general darshan at the residence of Shrii Mathur and the DMC was
arranged in the house of Acarya Kishanji. This house belonged to a rich man and was
in the style of a ‘haveli’, having a big courtyard and verandah. DMC was held in the
courtyard. It was completely full of devotees. Many disciple brothers arrived from
neighbouring areas on the day of the DMC, so the number was large.
Before Baba arrived, the whole courtyard and the verandas were over-full.
There was not a space vacant. The organisers of Muzaffarpur did not know that there
were so many disciples in that area. The courtyard and verandas were as if converted
into the “Pushpak Viman” (a house of flowers), by Baba, where the accommodation
became sufficient for all those who came. Everyone who came got a place to sit.
A beautiful platform was raised for Baba’s seat. The Lord of the hearts of the
devotees, most worshipful Baba, arrived in the DMC and cries of "Victory to Baba" rent
the air as the devotees welcomed Him. Baba who is bliss Himself took his seat. Shrii
Kishanji and Sakaldeoji offered their garlands to Baba and one of the devotees began
to sing a welcome song.
As soon as Baba entered, the whole atmosphere became electrified. That sight
was worth seeing. Someone was vibrating and his limbs were trembling and others
were looking at Him with unblinking eyes. Someone was crying, “Baba’ Baba”,
someone else was unconsciously roraring “hum” and yet another seemed to be
dancing even whilst sitting. Everyone was carried away with emotion. Such was the
vibration that none remained unaffected and everyone began to float in this devotional
ocean. The devotee who was singing, began to weep and his throat began to choke, so
he stopped. Another devotee with another song made an effort to sing another
welcome song, but on account of the flow of tears, he also could not complete his song
as his voice also began to tremble.
Baba’s splendour as He sat on the platform was matchless. It is not possible to
record that wonderful and glorious sight. The slightly pinkish colour on his white
complexion was fascinating. This arrested everyone’s attention almost unknowingly.
The subject of discourse of DMC was ‘Vyapti ka Aeshvarya’ - 'The Glory of
the All-pervasive’. Everyone was listening to Baba with rapt attention only broken by
the occasional emotional cry of “Baba, Baba”, from some devotee.
After the discourse was over we did guru puja together and many people had
the good fortune of personal contact with Baba. There was one specialty about this
DMC. The old father of Acaryai Vindhyachal Panday expressed a desire to see Baba
and touch His feet. He was not only very old but also very week due to illness and he
could not walk without support. Acarya Vindhyachalji brought his father in the DMC with
the assistance of two people and he got the opportunity both of Baba’s darshan and of
touching his feet and was extremely gratified.th
On the 29 January 1957, Baba left for Jamalpur, looking at the crowd of
devotees in Muzaffarpur DMC. Now Ananda Marga was taking a bigger and bigger
shape and the pracar work was progressing most satisfactorily. It was growing by leaps
and bounds.
I became acquainted with many new Margii brothers during the DMC, From
Jamalpur Shrii Bindeshwariji had come along with other devotees. After the DMC, he
kindly agreed to spend one night with me. Similarly Shri Ram Khelavanji of Jamalpur
stayed with me along with members of his family. While I was in Jamalpur this family
had not been initiated so this was my first contact with them. Every member of this
family whether young or old had immense devotion for Baba. Shri Ram Khelavanji
himself is a person of extremely simple nature and of pleasant temperament and all his
children have inherited these qualities in full measure. All are exemplars of devotion
and service.
These days Bindeshwariji was mostly in an abnormal state, but every member
of Ram Khelavanji's family always served him wholeheartedly and even today they look
after him. Every member of Ram Khelavanji's family has not only a spiritual relationship
with Baba but they also consider themselves to be His children. Baba also responds to
these relationships with equal love. After more than twenty-five years, these
relationships have flowered into great devotional expressions. Blessed is the family of
Ram Khelavanji .All his daughters are like Miiras of this age.
