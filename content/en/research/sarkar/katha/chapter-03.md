Jamalpur ! Let me but hear the name – indeed, let me but think it – and my mind is awash with images. Baba is gone from Jamalpur, but the disciples of His days there will never forget. Jamalpur itself will never forget.

Jamalpur and my Baba stories of Jamalpur are now memories. 

When people ask me about Jamalpur, before I can say anything, I am lost in the world of memory. All
the events of that period flash on my mental plate like a series of pictures and I am at a
loss where to begin.
I picture those narrow streets of the town through which Baba used to go to his
office everyday; those evening walks in the vast green field surrounded by beautiful
hills and His enjoyment of the pure, scented air there. And then I picture Baba sitting on
the tiger’s grave in the midst of the field and teaching His dear disciples there; His
walking the pathways lined with the waiting lines of devotees, sadhakas and spiritual
adepts. Baba calling some of them lovingly, throwing graceful looks at some and
overwhelming others with his loving eyes and glances – these things are like a dream
today, but then it was our everyday routine.
Everyday, but never taken for granted. Even then I glimpsed from time to time
the desolation that would follow when that phase of our lives was no more. When
things changed, as they would, as they must - when Baba moved on to the next phase
of His mission, when the organization outgrew the intense, intimate structure it had in
its beginnings – then some of us were left with a permanent insatiable hunger for those
past days of Jamlapur.
Beyond the town, I see the vast green field spread out before me, bounded on
two sides by beautiful hills. There in my imagination I find Baba on His evening walk
accompanied by a small group of His disciples. Now I envision the tiger’s grave, a
stone platform at one end of the field some distance from a trio of lofty palms. There
sits Baba, clothed in white, teaching the disciples who sit at His feet while the cool and
fragrant breeze ministers to His presence.
This scene glows so vividly before my inner eye that for a moment it seems
more real than the room where I sit writing, the table and the paper in front of me, and
the events of the intervening years. At the mere thought of Jamalpur, many mysterious
and enlightening events spring to mind. Even as I write, tears of spiritual bliss
overcome me. Those moments in Jamalpur have left deep and lasting impressions, a
soothing touch and satisfaction that will remain with me for the rest of my life. If nothing
can ever bring back those days, neither can anything ever take them away.
What is this place, this town and it’s surroundings,that are so central to the story
of Ananda Marga’s inception? Most disciples will never visit Jamalpur, and many may
see it only as a place of history. Yet to remember Jamalpur merely as a historical site
feels so arid. To me, to those who were with Baba in those early days, Jamalpur
quivers with a living presence, and the heart swells with love and longing for the
rapturous experiences of those times.
Jamalpur represents a phase in Baba’s play, before His leadership of a
worldwide organization placed such rigorous demands on Him that it deprived His
disciples of the close proximity of the Jamalpur era.Let me now, then, with some effort, disentangle myself from the clinging
embrace of personal reminiscences and introduce Jamalpur as it was at that midpoint
of the twentieth century.
To begin with, Jamalpur was a relatively small, insignificant town located near
the River Ganges in Bihar. Because of it’s geographical position, it gained importance
with the increasing prominence of rail transport during the British era. Around the turn
of the twentieth century, Jamalpur became a major railway station, and some years
later, one of the largest railway workshops in India was constructed there. Besides
housing the railway repairs workshop, it was also a factory for engine parts and
constructing passenger bogies. Even today, Jamalpur’s internal economy and external
significance depends on the railways.
The Jamalpur railway station stretches north-south. Immediately to the west of
the station are the markets and the town-centre. Nearby is the Jubilee Well, and the
rest of the town is to the west. To the east of the station stand a few houses, offices,
and a hospital, all belonging to the Eastern Railways. Farther to the south-east ranges
the broad expanse of grassy land known as the Jamalpur field.
Two bridges, one wide and one narrow, span the rail lines, linking the town on
the west with the field and its surrounding area on the east. Traffic across the wide
bridge, most of it foot traffic, was light in those days, although today there are vehicles
crossing.
Each evening it was Baba’s custom to walk from His home to the field, a
distance of about two-and-a-half miles. He took this at a leisurely pace and the
distance was covered in approximately three-quarters of an hour. Baba occasionally
crossed the tracks by way of the narrow bridge, but most often used the wide bridge
when going to and from the field.
The Jamalpur field is one of nature’s jewels. The encroachments of civilization
and commerce have not yet eradicated the features that give this spot its rare beauty.
Its gentle contours give the two square mile area a feeling of dynamic tranquillity.
Occasional banyans and mango trees grow among the palms that grace the landscape
in groups large and small, interspersed with shrubbery and arranged in subtle patterns
too pleasing to have been contrived by the clumsy hand of humans. Free-roaming
cattle, sheep and goats bear witness to the liberty this environment affords to all life.
South-eastward, the field slopes into a long basin in which reposes a crystal
lake reflecting in untarnished hues, the serene splendour of the place. Dark forests that
once covered this region now mark only the eastern perimeter of the lake and the field.
Beyond, to the east, hills rise up like a sigh from nature’s breast, then fall softly away in
the distance. Shading to purple and blue as dusk approaches., they calm the spirit,
leading the eye toward stillness as they lead the mind toward permanence.
For the past few decades, the government has been mining in these hills for the
marketable coloured stones indiginous to the area.
Next to the lake and south of the field, is ‘Death Valley’, so called because it
was once the refuge of brigands and cutthroats. As recently as a century ago, Death
Valley, the lake-shore, part of the field and the hills beyond were all but a dense jungle.
Wild animals roamed freely, uninhabited by the proximity of civilzation. Even after the
workshop was established, these jungles still abounded, and British officers used to go
a hunting and riding in them.THE TIGER’S GRAVE
In July 1864 one Englishman out hunting with his two dogs, confronted a tiger in
the field bordering the jungle. No one knows how long they fought, but both died as a
result of this encounter. In the morning, people found the tiger dead whilst the wounded
Englishman had crawled home and died there. The people must have felt sorry for the
death of the brave hunter, but they felt that the man with arms and the wild animal
without any weapon must have fought bravely and long and no one could say as to
who won and who lost. Therefore the Englishmen constructed two graves there, one
for the hunter and one for the tiger.
For reasons known only to Himself, Baba preferred to sit on the grave of the
tiger and he selected it as His resting place during His daily walks in that field unless
someone else was sitting there. In that event, He would sit on the grave of the
Englishman.
While sitting on these graves Baba guided many souls and gave many
demonstrations of mystical states, contributing much to the spiritual knowledge of
humanity. These were the places where some disciples attained liberation and many
ordinary disciples like myself saw Baba’s loving and compassionate guidance in their
daily lives, both spiritual and worldly.
This sacred field of Jamalpur screened with green and lofty hills, and containing
in its bosom those graves, palms and other trees, has been the silent and mute witness
of the liilas and grace of Baba for decades. Had these graves and trees been fitted with
vocal chords, they would have narrated the history of Jamalpur for hundreds of years
and also told the story of Baba right from his childhood day s for the entire period of his
stay in Jamalpur.
Near these graves stand three tall palm trees in a triangle where Baba used
sometimes to sit also. Under these palm trees many fortunate brothers got their
initiation from Baba.
By these graves or under these trees many great souls either in physical or
subtle bodies, had wandered eagerly for a glimpse of the lotus feet of Baba. On this
grave Baba gave innumerable teachings, and enumerated diverse subjects. Hardly any
subject on spirituality or morality has been left undiscussed in these environs.
When Baba would sit on the tiger’s grave the triangle of the palm trees would
be behind Him and on his right was a banyan tree. On the left was the grave of the
English hunter and one mango tree. The palms at the back were about forty of fifty
yards away. The grave and the mango tree were about ten to fifteen yards away on the
left.
I remember Baba telling us that this the banyan tree before adopting this form,
had been a notorious dacoit, extremely callous and murderous. He now stands
converted into this tree.
KARNA’S KINGDOM OF ANGADESH
One evening Baba was seated on the grave of the tiger and I was sitting at His
feet. Baba was looking at a distant hill on his right. After some time breaking his silence
Baba pointed out, “Nagina, look at that distant bill. That was the boundary of
Angadesh, the kingdom of Karna 3,500 years ago. His capital was where Nathnagar in
Bihar is situated today. Once the Pandavas attacked Karna in the night taking him
completely by surprise. As it was night-time, by the time Karna recollected his armyand wits, the Pandavas had destroyed a big part of his army. But once Karna came into
his own, he fought a terrible battle and pushed the Pandavas back. He continued the
bottle with the Pandavas as long as he did not drive them out complete from his
kingdom”.
Baba’s liilas of Jamalpur are unforgettable. Now this mind of mine which was
never satiated with His affectionate and magnetic company, only yearns in pain to think
of those days. Since then all the devotees of Jamalpur are waiting anxiously for those
days to return and waiting for the revival of these sweet days and their memories.
After Baba left Jamalpur, Jamalpur is in the same condition as Braj, the
childhood home of Krsna, was, after Krsna left it for Mathura. Jamalpur is now giving a
deserted look like Braj. Now we are reminded of that beautiful poem of Surdas where
he describes the pangs of separation of the residents of Braj in these immortal lines:
“Who can describe the story of Braj?
The gopiis and the cows the cowherds,
Everyone is lean and sad in the memory of Krsna”
Although Baba has left Jamalpur to fulfill his mission, just as Krishna had left
Braj, yet every particle of dust of Jamalpur is vibrating with the contact of his holy feet
and is unwilling to forget those happy days. Even today the devotees of Jamalpur
although weak in body due to pangs of separation from the lord are keeping his
memory fresh.
Not that Jamalpur alone is yearning for Baba. Baba also in his quiet moments
must be remembering Jamalpur with love and longing affection. He must also be
saying like Krsna in the words of Surdas: -
“Uddhava I am unable to forget Braj.”
I feel satisfied that like this, Baba must be remembering all of us devotees,
whenever be must be thinking of Jamalpur.
By His many years in Jamalpur Baba has made it a sacred place not only for
Ananda Margiis but for all humanity and posterity. Therefore it is my earnest plea to
Baba that He may fill this sacred place to the brim with overwhelming devotional
sentiment so that every sadhaka who visits here may be plunged deep in the ocean of
love and spirituality. Let Jamalpur acquire immortality.
