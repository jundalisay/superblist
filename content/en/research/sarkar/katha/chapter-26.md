Baba is very fond of discipline yet he likes the rational acts of Margiis. Once it
so happened that I had to ask something about sadhana from Baba, but Baba those
days was so busy that I was not getting opportunity to ask him. Whenever I would go to
Baba I found him extremely busy. When after many attempts also I did not get an
opportunity, I was forced to tell everything to the manager of the ashram and I requested him to ask Baba about the solutions to my problems, and let me know what He had instructed .

The manager asked Baba and told me. That day also like other days I went to
Baba’s residence to do my sastaunga pranam and accompanied Him on his walk
afterwards. Now look at the Lila of Baba. That day I was alone on the walk with Him.
After walking for some distance, Baba said, “I am both your acarya and guru,
and even then you discussed matters related to sadhana with the ashram manager to
be relayed to me! Why did you adopt this course?”
As I heard this question, I was reminded of the promise I had taken at the time
of initiation and I was struck dumb.
I said, “Baba, when ever after several attempts I did not get an opportunity to
ask you myself, I had to refer them to you through the manger as he is also the
General Secretary of the Marga”.

Baba said, “So you mentioned them to him as the General Secretary of the
Marga?”
I replied in the affirmative. Baba found this rational and then said, “This is
alright”
Thus, although earlier I did not get an opportunity to be with him for so many
days He now gave me all the time I needed.
RAM BAHADUR SINGH: HIS INITIATION
While I was in Jamalpur staying with Bindeshwariji, one or his relations came on
a visit. I knew him also. His name is Shri Ram Bahadur Singh. These days he was
enforcement officer in the Transport Department of Bihar Government posted at
Bhagalpur. Jamalpur was within his jurisdiction, he therefore, had to visit this place
frequently, and whenever he would come to Jamalpur he would always pay a visit to
Bindeshwariji, even though it may be a short one. Shri Bindeshwariji was always
encouraging him to do sadhana.
Acarya Chandranathji and Acarya Kishanji were also amongst the friends of
Shri Ram Bahadur Singhji and he was quite impressed by the change in lifestyle of
these two persons due to sadhana. Thus in the summer of 1955, he also took initiation.
After some days his wife also got initiated. Now both began to help each other in
Sadhana.In a very short time Shri Ram Bahadur Singh developed great faith and
devotion for Baba Whenever he would come to Monghyr for any work he would always
avail himself of Baba’s darshan. Meanwhile he was transferred to Patna.
In 1959, when Baba went to Patna he paid a surprise visit to Ram Bahadurji’s
residence. Both the husband and wife were overwhelmed with emotion and felt very,
very happy finding Baba as their guest. Both began to shed tears of devotion.
After two or three months Shri Ram Bahadur was transferred to Barhi. This is a
small place, but an important road junction in South Bihar, and this posting was
considered important in the transport department. Here he remained for about one and
a half years only, but during this period while going to Ranchi and Gaya, he stayed at
his house thrice. When Ram Bahadurji was narrating his experiences, his wife in her
deep devotion would and her own with great pleasure. Shri Ram Bahadurji is very
fortunate in this respect everyone in his family from a child to the oldest is devoted to
Baba.
RAM BAHADUR SINGH AND THE MYSTERY WATCH-DOGS
Once his wife told about their stay in Barhi, that Shri Ram Bahadurji had some
trouble with his left eye and therefore had to be admitted to Patna hospital. She was
alone in Barhi with her young children. As their residence was in a lonely place she
became very much frightened and she began to pray to Baba for help. Baba heard her
prayer and before evening that very day two strange strong black dogs – who were
quite frightening in looks – all of a sudden came to his house and began to stay there.
Both these dogs were extremely efficient in looking after the protection of the house
and its inhabitants. Nobody could dare to roam in the vicinity of the house even.
Looking at their loyalty Shrimati Ram Bahadur felt somewhat reassured of her
safety. For about two and a half months Shrii Ram Bahadurji was in the hospital and
during his absence these black dogs continued to protect his house with great care.
The day Shrii Ram Bahadurji returned from the hospital, these two dogs
disappeared nobody knew where. None saw them ever thereafter. Who were they in
the form of these two dogs from where they came and where they disappeared – we
can know only if Baba kindly tells us about it. Their arrival and departure remained a
mystery. Baba gives his grace in strange ways. If we think, we find that every action of
his is a miracle.
th
Shrii Ram Bahadurji returned from the hospital on 16 October 1959 without
any success and in a hopeless state. After two and a half months treatment the
specialists and doctors told him that his eyesight could be restored only through god’s
grace. According to the doctors the disease had no cure and he could never see with
his left eye.
BABA VISITS RAM BAHADUR
That very day at about nine in the morning Baba suddenly came to Barhi at
Shrii Ram Bahadurji’s residence. This was the most happy surprise for him. Baba was
on His way to DMC at Ranchi. Both husband and wife began to welcome and serve
Baba with great devotion and love. Acarya Shri Devii Chandra Sharma and another
devoted sadhakas Shrii Balandaji where with Baba.
“I want to take my both and do my puja. If there is no difficulty, please arrange
for the same.” said Baba.Then Baba told to Mrs. Ram Bahadurji, “Mother, you make arrangements for
some food. I shall take my food after puja and then leave”.
Hearing these words from Baba’s mouth, both husband and wife felt extremely
overwhelmed with joy and emotion, they began to dance with joy and their state was of
extreme bliss.
The Lord himself comes and becomes a guest – will this not madden any
devotee with joy? This was like Ram’s visit to the residence of Shabri or like Krsna
coming to the house of Vidura. The mental condition of both husband and wife was like
that of Vidura and Shabri. Both were, as if electrified and began to do Baba’s work with
their own hands in great speed.
By the time Baba had finished His bath and sadhana, Mrs. Ram Bahadur had
prepared tasty rich and various sattvika dishes for Baba’s food. Both husband and wife
began to serve Baba with great love and hospitality and with Baba others were also
served Baba took some rest while those who came with Him took their food and when
they were ready, Baba also was prepared to start on His journey. Both husband and
wife with their children did sastaunga pranam to Baba and were greatly satisfied when
they received His blessings – they thanked their stars. Great are this couple and their
devotion.
Ram Bahadurji also accompanied Baba on His way.
th
th
On 16 and 17 October 1959, there was DMC at Ranchi where Baba delivered
th
discourses to the Margiis and on the 18 Baba returned to Jamalpur. Acarya Amulya
Ratan Sarangiji accompanied Baba from Ranchi and they passed through Dhanbad,
Dumka and Bhagalpur on the way to Jamalpur, where they arrived the next day.
Acarya Sarangiji drove the car up to Dumka where Baba ordered Shri Ram
Bahadurji to take the wheel. Shri Ram Bahadurji ignored the pain in his eye and without
a hitch took the steering and began to drive. Although his left eye was in great pain,
which continued up to Dumka Ram Bahadurji bone it without allowing its expression to
come on his face. He drove the car for about 120 miles in this condition and brought
Baba to Jamalpur. It was a miracle that as long as he drove the car, the pain
completely disappeared.
BABA CURES RAM BAHADUR
Later Baba taught him a prescription for preparing an ainjana (eye-powder) and
told him, “ By using this powder your eye will regain its normal health. “
But Ram Bahadurji had seen that as long as he was in the service of Baba and
was driving the car, the pain had disappeared. He therefore did not pay any special
need towards the prescription for the eye powder. After reaching Jamalpur, Ram
Bahadurji left Baba at his residence and along with his companions came to the jagrti.
Here they stayed for three days and had the privilege of Baba’s darshan every morning
and evening.
On the third day, in the evening walk Shri Amulya Ratna Sarangi, Acarya Devi
Chandra Sharma, Shri Balendriji and Shri Ram Bahadurji were with him. All of them
went with Baba up to his residence. After reaching his house Baba told Shri Amulya
Ratna Sarangi to take Ram Bahadurji up to Barhi. At that stage Acarya Devi Chandra
Sharma prayed that Baba may be pleased and may cure the illness of Ram Bahadurji’s
eye so that he may regain his eyesight.Baba said, “I have explained to him the method of preparing an eye-
powder which will cure the pain in his eyes.”
Ram Bahadur was still silent when Baba spoke again and said, “I asked Ram
Bahadur at the time of Hajipur DMG whether his health was alright and Ram Bahadur
had replied that he never felt ill. Even so Baba looked at his ailing eye and said,
Na bhuktam kashiyate karma kalpa koti shatairapi
Avashyameva bhoktavyam kritam karma shubhashubham
Baba said, “When the flood comes, it leaves some effect behind”.
So saying Baba pressed his finger just above the left eye of Ram Bahadurji.
Shri Ram Bahadur felt that as Baba pressed his eye, instantaneously the pain
in the eye disappeared and the also felt that some light entered his left eye.
At about eleven o’clock in the night Ram Bahadur returned from Baba’s
residence along with his friends and after reaching the Jagrti he tried to read the
newspaper with his left eye. His wonder and joy knew no bounds, when he succeeded
in reading the newspaper without the specs and with case. He felt greatly moved and
thankful by getting this causeless grace of Baba and the miraculous healing touch of
his finger. The statement of the doctors that without god’s Grace his left eye cannot be
cured proved true to every letter. While standing these experiences, both husband and
wife were full of emotions and tears were rolling down their eyes.
BABA VISITS RAM BAHADUR AGAIN
th
The 27 December 1959 proved to be the most auspicious and fortunate day in
the life of Ram Bahadurji, when Baba paid another surprise visit to him. This time Baba
did not stay long at Barhi. Even so both husband and wife were overwhelmed by
Baba’s Grace.
Whilst at Ram Bahadurji’s residence, Baba asked for paper and pen. Ram
Bahadurji rushed to get paper and pen and placed them before Baba. Then Baba jotted
down His blessings in the following manner:
"As a soldier you most not search for worldly pleasure or comfort. Be
ready for all sorts of sufferings. Let suffering be your asset. Suffering will help
you in establishing the Sadvipra Raj. You must not argue, you must not think
twice, you should “do or die”. I do not want to see the face of a defeated son in
flesh and blood”.
Barahi

Yours
Baba
All the members of the family of Ram Bahadurji were overjoyed having had
Baba’s darshan and having received his blessing. While describing this unbounded
grace and kindness of Baba, Ram Bahadurji becomes so sentimental that he moves
even the stony hearts to devotion and faith. How fortunate are Ram Bahadurji and his
wife.
Only a few days must have passed when Baba’s car again reached in front of
Shri Ram Bahadurji’s house and the Lord called Ram Bahadurji. Shri Ram Bahadur,
his wife and children all ran and came and fell at Baba’s feet.Really fortunate is this family that the lord comes Himself again and again to
give them darshan. This was the third such fortunate occasion. This time Baba
remained in His car, gave blessings to him and the members of his family and resumed
his journey towards place where he was going.
Seeing the simplicity and the pure hearts of this family. Baba graced them with
still greater proximity and Shri Ram Bahadurji was transferred to Jamalpur. He
remained in Jamalpur for nearly three years as D.S.P. in the Bihar Military Police.
There he had Baba’s darshan every day and accompanied him on his evening walks.
He would join all he D.M.C. that were held in the neighborhood. After his official duties
most of his time was spent in devotional mood and activities.
In the meanwhile his wife fell ill and was bedridden for nearly eight months. The
disease took a dangerous turn and his wife remained unconscious for nearly three
days. After she regained consciousness she informed that during the period of
unconsciousness she was feeling that two sadhus in matted hair were constantly sitting
besides her and giving her solace all the time. By the grace of Baba she regained her
health. It appeared that Baba brought them to Jamalpur so that his wife’s illness may
not become out of control. While describing her illness the wife of Ram Bahadurji said
in a voice full of devotion, that she survived that serious illness only through the grace
of Baba.
Shri Ram Bahadurji meanwhile was having Baba’s darshan everyday and
bathing happily in the flow of the Ganges of Devotion of Baba. His main occupation
was always singing the glory of Baba’s name and qualities. For the very beginning he
was fond of three things: sentient food, mediation and devotion. I have already
mentioned about the excellence of his devotion. Now I shall refer to some of his other
traits. He was always fond of good cooking. Good cooking, good food and enjoyed
taking heavy meals.
During his stay in Jamalpur he participated enthusiastically in the function of
Ananda Purnima. There was also a programme of collective feast amongst the
celebrations. His entire enthusiasm was concentrated on items of the feast and food.
Shri Ram Bahadurji kept on leaving the company of Baba to look after the
arrangements of cooking and the feast. Omniscient Baba knew about it and Baba gave
him a new name. This is so suitable and true to his nature. Baba called him. ‘Shrii
Bhojanand’ (one who relishes his food). At this everyone present laughed heartily and
since then old Margiis knew him only as Shri Bhojanandji.
In bringing about a devotional mood, songs, kiirtan and dance are always very
helpful. Therefore Shri Bhojanandji is extremely fond of devotional songs, kiirtan and
dance When he starts singing like Narada in his own tune, rhythm and voice, all the
arts of music, including tunes, meters rhythms fall on the wayside. These arts are
afraid, lest he should grasp them forever. Even so, unmindful of all of them, be enjoys
his devotional songs and kiirtan. There is no fixed tune for his singing and kiirtan. He
bursts into them at his own sweet will and continues as long as his mood lasts.
Due to the grace and contact with Baba, he became quite prosperous and was
transferred to Dhanbad. There he did yeoman’s work to spread the philosophy and
idealism of the mission and in the month of October 1968 with the help of local Margiis
and after obtaining Baba’s permission he arranged DMG at Dhanbad.
DHANBAD DMC
This DMC was most successful. He had made preparation for taking out, agrand procession. However, it began to rain just when the procession was to start. Shri
Ram Bahadurji prayed to Baba that he might be pleased and bless so that the
procession may be takeout. Rev. Baba was happy and conceded his request. The
rains stopped and the Margiis took out the procession with great enthusiasm.
Mrs. Ram Bahadur Singh was in charge of making arrangements for Baba’s
food and she dedicated herself fully to this task. Baba told them after his evening walk.
That he has gone to their residence and looked at it from outside and come back. How
kind and graceful in Baba and how fortunate are Mr. and Mrs. Ram Bahadurji whom
Baba has granted such devotion and faith.
BABA LISTENS TO THE PRAYERS OF RAM BAHADURJI THE GREAT DEVOTEE
th
Only recently on 27 December 1981 I was going to Ananda Nagar, for the
DMC along with my family. Shri Ram Bahadur was also travelling by the same train
along with his family. Our train was more than eight hours late and so we missed the
connection in Dhandbad. We decided to hire a tax but as we discovered, neither the
taxi driver nor we knew the way.
At about six in the evening our taxi reached the Chas police post and the taxi
driver and the owner were not prepared to go any further that night. The night was dark
and the way was unknown. The unmetalled road passed through a dense forest. Our
difficulty was that ladies and children were with us and there was so place where we
could stay.
Under the circumstances, it seemed that pressing on and reaching Ananda
Nagar somehow, was the only course open to us. Even the police officers requested
the taxi-driver to proceed, but he was adamant. Feeling completely helpless, I
requested Shri Ram Bahadurji to pray for Baba’s help. At first he made several
excuses, but when I reminded him about the saying of the great saint Vyaas, who
wrote the Mahabharat and many Puranas:
“There are two truths embedded in the eighteen Puranas-one is that virtue
means helping the needy and vice means causing pain to others”.
And I asked him to help us in our hour of need by asking Baba for help. Looking
at our difficulties he fell silent for sometime and remembered Baba and asked Him to
remove our difficulty. And lo, a miracle happened in a few minutes. Three persons on a
motorcycle reached the spot where we were, and enquired what the trouble was, while
we and the policemen were talking to the taxi-man.
“What is the trouble?” they enquired.
Shri Ram Bahadur pointed out that we were going to Ananda Nagar, but due to
our ignorance about the way, the night being dark and the road being irregular and
passing through a forest, the taxi-driver was not prepared to move forward.
The riders on the motor cycle said, “We too are going to Ananda Nagar” and
they asked the driver to follow them without any worry.
The driver pleaded that he might lose his way on the way back but the riders on
the motorcycle informed him that they were coming from Dhanbad as contractors to
erect the pandal at Ananda Nagar. Their truck with the goods had gone ahead and
when they reach Ananda Nagar, the truck would return to Dhanbad. They suggested
that the taxi might return with the truck from Ananda Nagar to Dhanbad.Now the driver was left with no excuse and when the police officers pressed
him further, he had to carry us to Ananda Nagar. From there for the entire way, Shri
Ram Bahadur continued to sing ‘Baba Nam Kevalam’. We reached Ananda Nagar at
about eight thirty in the night. This was the result of Shri Ram Bahadurji's deep
devotion for Baba that we reached Ananda Nagar safety that evening. Great is Baba
and blessed is Shri Ram Bahadurji and his devotion to Baba that his messengers on
the motorcycle solved our difficulty.
My acquaintance with the family of Shri Ram Bahadurji is an old one. This time
when we were returning from the Jan. 82 DMC Shri Ram Bahadurji and his wife were
kind enough to relate these experience to me. All the events are connected with Baba
and inspiring for the Sadhakas. I have, therefore, mentioned them here after taking his
permission. He had many more such experience and I have requested him that he
should put them in black and white for inclusion in Ananda Kathas. He has agreed to
do so. Let us see when be kindly does it.
th
It is a matter of great sorrow that on 29 December 1982 suddenly after doing
his pancajanya, Shri Ram Bahadurji left his body for his heavenly abode. It is my
prayer with Baba that his soul may rest in eternal peace and salvation.
