While I was still at Jamalpur, it was decided that DMC of Maghi Full Moon would be held on the 5th February 1955. I was staying with Bindeshwariji, therefore, I requested him also to attend it. Due to his family circumstances, it was rather difficult for him to go.

Therefore, also he wanted to go he expressed his inability. But I insisted so much that finally he agreed and the members of his family also unwillingly allowed him to attend the DMC.

Both of us together went to Bhagalpur and that very evening participated in the DMC. The DMC was being held in a big room in the house of respectful Chandranathji.

At the time of DMC Bindeshwariji and myself were sitting a little apart from each other. I was in the fourth or fifth row in the front and Bindeshwariji was sitting on the left of the couch in the front row. As Baba's discourse was about to end suddenly Baba looked at

Bindeshwariji and told him not to worry.

BABA GRANTS NEW LIFE TO BINDESHWARIJI

Everyone looked at Bindeshwariji. Bindeshwariji at that time was breathing
heavily and sitting in sukhasana and was only uttering " No!” No! While we were trying
to understand the situation Bindeshwariji kept calling out, "No! No!” and still sitting in
sukhasana began to move towards Baba. He placed his head on Baba's lap and again
began to call, “No!” No!” He was moving without taking any help of his hands in such a
manner as iron is drawn towards a magnet. We were unable to understand anything.
Meanwhile Baba motioned to me and asked that Bindeshwariji may be taken
out. I helped Bindeshwariji to rise and took him to the drawing room of Bindeshwariji
and there laid him on a Sofa. There also he continued to repeat, " No! "No! In between
he was uttering irrelevant or unintelligible things also.
I was in the meanwhile called in by Baba. I left Bindeshwariji to the care of other
disciple brothers and went to Baba. Baba asked everyone else to leave the room and
when I was left alone with Baba, He said to me, "At that time Bindeshwariji was dying,
but as the place and time were not proper I had given him another lease of life. Also his
body is old, but I have just given him pranah and mind, therefore he will behave like an
infant. From today you will have to look after him just as one looks after a small child”.
At the same time Baba said, "Don't tell Bindeshwariji that he was dying and I
have deferred the moment". After these instructions Baba asked me to go and look
after him. I was thinking in my mind that in my life I had not looked even after my own
children and how was I to look after him. I had no experience of caring for children and
how I was going to perform this duty in respect of an old child?
In this confused state of mind I reached Bindeshwariji and saw that he was
surrounded by other disciple brothers. While lying sometimes he was laughing and
sometimes he was calling the name of his wife and saying that today her husband has
been saved from the jaws of death. His eyes were still closed, as they were when he
was removed from Baba's presence and he was still breathing heavily. In that condition
again he was again and again mentioning about his wife's good fortune that her
husband has survived.I asked him "What are you saying? What has happened to you?"
At this he told me, "Today Baba has given me life back only on account of you
and that is why my wife has been saved from widowhood. Had you not forcibly brought
me here, my death was sure to take place at that time”.
I thought, “Baba had said that Bindeshwariji should not know this, but he is
talking on his own about his death and the granting of new life to him. What has
happened?”
I immediately returned to Baba and told Him, "Baba you said that Bindeshwariji
should not know about his death but he himself is talking about his death and grant of
life and about the good fortune of his wife."
At this Baba said, "How did it happen?"
I pleaded innocence and said that as I reached him he was already talking in
this manner.
Baba closed his eyes for a moment and then opened them and said, "When he
was dying I gave a portion of my mind and pranah to him and therefore he knows My
mind. Anyway, let him say so, you will always tell him forcefully that he was talking
nonsense. You will have to be very cautious and careful in this matter."
Now it was a second problem for me that Bindeshwariji would tell the truth and I
would again and again tell him that he was wrong. Even otherwise it was difficult to
take care of such an old child and now I was to go on telling him that he was not
correct in his thought. On my own I could not manage this, therefore, I left everything
on Baba and as ordered by Baba, began to look after him. In Bhagalpur when ever he
would talk of the gift of life to him and about the saving of his wife's marital life, I would
call his talk that of a mad man or say that he was talking nonsense, thus trying to
quieten him. Sometimes Bindeshwariji would laugh away my statements and
sometimes he would show his irritation at them. Although we did not stay long at
Bhagalpur after the DMC, still this news spread amongst all the Margii brothers there.
CARING FOR BINDESHWARIJI
I returned with Bindeshwariji to Jamalpur that very night. Somehow that night
passed off. But next morning his brother and other relatives began to enquire about his
abnormality from me. I did not know how to satisfy them. I would only say, "He is not
well. Please leave him alone."
Bindeshwariji was always in Baba bhava or Brahma bhava. Whenever anyone
questioned him, he will either feel irritated or start weeping. It became his nature to
laugh one moment and weep another. Sometimes his whole body would start
trembling, his face would turn red and he would again become quiet and breathe
heavily. All the times he was saying Baba! Baba! In the night he would sleep with me
and liked to curl up in my lap. In this manner I spent two days and two nights without
sleep and somehow looked after him, but my misery increased when his brother and
relations began to blame me for what they called his madness, as it was I who had
insisted on his going to Jamalpur.
Bindeshwariji was constantly abnormal and his irritation increased all the more
when he heard them. And as he felt irritated his abnormality would increase. I got
highly perplexed and disturbed at having to bear the caustic comments ofBindeshwariji's brother and relations. I requested one of the disciple brothers to inform
Baba about it.
Baba sent me word through him that in the evening I should to Him along with
Bindeshwariji. Accordingly we reached there. There Bindeshwariji again became
abnormal as soon as he did his sastaunga pranam to Him. Baba rebuked him and also
educated him. After a long time he became somewhat normal.
Baba then told him, "Look what you have done to Nagina! He cannot sleep well
in the night and looking at your condition all your relatives also blame him. All this is
because of you."
Hearing this from Baba, Bindeshwariji began to catch hold of his own ears in a
gesture of repentance and he promised that he would never be so abnormal again.
Baba was throughout in a sombre mood when He was talking to Bindeshwariji.
Now, getting Baba's permission I left Bindeshwariji at His residence and went
for a field walk along with Baba. While walking, Baba told me, "Keep Bindeshwariji
away from me for some days for he will become more abnormal in my presence.
Whenever he becomes abnormal at his house tell him that Baba would be angry if you
behave like this and this is not what Baba wants you to do. When you will tell him this
he will become quiet."
From next day whenever he would become abnormal, I would apply the formula
given by Baba and this will bring him back to normalcy very soon.
My sister's husband is a cousin and good chum of Bindeshwariji. I called him
also there to help me. My brother-in-law was not a Margii. His arrival gave me some
respite. By now somehow I had persuaded Bindeshwariji to sleep on a separate cot.
He agreed to this on one condition that my cot would also be at his side. I agreed. I
was always cautious that he might not be put in any inconvenience or trouble. But
sometimes it would cause me trouble.
When I was in Jamalpur I followed Baba's instruction and took my evening
meals before sunset and would only take a cup of hot milk in the night. One day I
returned from seeing Baba at about 10pm and found that Bindeshwariji was asleep
with a quilt over his face. I asked the cook whether Bindeshwariji had taken his food
before going to bed and then I washed and sat on my cot next to Bindeshwariji's bed.
The cook gave me my milk and I started drinking it.
Then I heard Bindeshwariji weeping like a child. When I asked him the reason
he was crying, he said tearfully, that I was drinking all the milk without sharing it with
him. I asked the cook whether he had given milk to Bindeshwariji. He replied that he
had taken his milk before going to bed. I enquired whether more milk was available. He
replied in the negative and informed me that it was not possible to get milk so late in
the night.
Now I wondered also how to pacify Bindeshwari. When all efforts to persuade
him to keep quiet failed, I asked him also what I should do to pacify him. At this he got
up from his bed and told me to give the milk that remained in my cup. I said that it was
left over after my drink and I hesitated to give it to him. He insisted on drinking the
same milk and began to cry for it again. In the end I have him the same milk. He drunk
it and laughed heartily like a child. After some time he slept. But after about half an
hour he began to weep like this again. I got up and enquired as to what he wanted. He
said he would like to sleep with me on my bed. I pleaded and persuaded in vain. In theend he had to be taken on my bed. I had to keep awake the whole night as I was not
accustomed to sleep like this.
Thereafter for a day or two he was normal and one night at about two in the
morning he said he wanted water to drink. There was water and jug in the room on a
table. I gave him a glass full but he refused to drink. I enquired as to what he wanted.
He kept quiet. After many enquiries he said that he would not drink that water. He
needs fresh water.
After hearing our talk their domestic servant came into our room and stood
there. He went to the well and brought fresh water. Even so he refused to drink it. By
now some of his relatives had also awakened and when everyone enquired what he
wanted, he told me in a commanding tone to go and bring the water myself from the
well. When I got up to do this one of his relative s forbade me quietly.
At this Bindeshwariji flared up and said to me that I should go and fetch the
water or he would break my head with a stick.
“You seem to feel you are a big officer and show me the status of a
superintendent”.
I listened to him quietly. When one of his relatives wanted to intervene, I
forbade him to do so. I brought the water from the well and gave it to him to drink. After
drinking this water he kept quiet for some time and then laughed heartily. Thereafter he
enquired whether I felt his bad behaviour. At this simple mindedness I also began to
laugh. Thereafter I tried to lull him to sleep.
