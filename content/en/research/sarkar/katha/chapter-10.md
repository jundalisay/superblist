In November 1954, Baba started giving demonstrations about the different
stages and utilities of sadhana. For instance the awakening of the kundalinii, its upward
surge, the position of various cakras, qualified and unqualified samadhi. The
demonstrations would take place in one of the railway colony quarters that Baba later
declared an ashram.
THE FIRST SUNDAY
On the first Sunday, 7th November 1954, Baba introduced his disciples to one
another for the first time. Unfortunately I could not be present that Sunday, but I later
learned that Baba had demonstrated savikalpa and nirvikalpa samadhis using Shri
Pranay Kumar Chatterjee as His subject. A fellow disciple told me that Baba would also
give similar demonstrations the following Sunday. I therefore decided to go to Baba the
following week.
I started from Begusarai in time, yet due to the belated start of the steamer, I
reached Monghyr Ghat rather late, and by then it was already evening. I thought that a
bus or cycle rickshaw would not be able to take me to Jamalpur in time, and the fear of
missing Baba's darshan and the demonstrations that Sunday began to arise in my
mind. I remembered Baba and earnestly requested Him mentally that somehow I
should be enabled to see the demonstrations that I was so keen to see though time
and circumstances were not working favourably. Baba heard my prayer and
immediately a taxi came and stopped in front of me.
I asked the taxi driver whether he would go to Jamalpur and he readily agreed. I
got in and asked the driver to go fast as I was to reach Jamalpur early. On the way I
again asked him to go faster, and he sped up even further.
I did not know the address of the quarter where the gathering was to take place
and amongst the thousands of quarters it would be most difficult to locate the correct
quarter, and so I was also requesting Baba internally to leave His quarter only after I
arrive at His house so that I could accompany Him to the railway quarter where He was
to speak.
As I reached Jamalpur station, I got a strange feeling that Baba was leaving His
quarter. I began to jump up in the running taxi thinking I was already too late. The taxi
driver was amazed to see my anxiety. I thought of running to catch Baba, but it dawned
on me that I would not run faster than the taxi, so I requested the driver to drive even
faster, quivering with impatience on the edge of my seat as if moving my body a few
inches nearer to Baba would make a critical difference.
The driver was amazed at my anxiety and said, “Sir I am already driving at 50 to
60 miles an hour inside the town and you are asking me to go faster! It would be
dangerous to do so”.By now we had reached the road to Baba’s house. I was very alert and
watching both sides for some brother sadhakas so that I could accompany them. We
had driven some distance down the road when I saw Baba walking with a few disciples.
I stopped the taxi, paid the driver, got down and touched Baba’s feet and did my
pranam. I was filled with joy and followed the group.
I knew one of the brother disciples who later said to me, “Baba purposely
delayed His departure from His quarter today. He left His residence only when He was
certain that you could meet us on the way”. I felt that this was the time when I had
frantically got up from my seat in the running taxi. I arrived at the quarter along with
Baba and He introduced me to all the other disciples gathered there. I was extremely
grateful for His grace.
This was my first time to see the demonstrations, which took place every
Sunday in November 1954. Baba gave a spectacular demonstration that I will never
forget.
Salutation to Baba who is One, Pure and Unmovable
THE SECOND SUNDAY
Baba gave the demonstration that day again making a senior sadhaka, Shri P.
K. Chatterjee as the subject. He asked him to sit in the lotus pose and to concentrate
his mind on his iista cakra, his point of concentration for meditation. Baba ordered the
man’s kundalinii, in Bengali language, and I am quoting His very words:-
“Kulakundalinii, I Yogeshvara Anandamurti order you to leave the muladhara
cakra and reach svadhisthana.”
As soon as the kundalinii left the muladhara cakra there was a vibration in Shri
Chatterjee’s body and this vibration increased a lot when the kundalinii crossed the
svadhisthana and proceeded towards the manipura cakra.
When the kundalinii reached the manipura cakra, he became peaceful for a
very short while and began to lean backwards while still seated in the lotus pose.
As long as the kundalinii did not reach the ajina plexus, such directions to the
kundalinii were repeated to move from one lower plexus to the higher one. I saw that at
each order the kundalinii would rise immediately.
As I was a novice in the world of mysticism, I could not understand whether the
kundalinii was following the orders after they were given or as the thought arose in His
mind she would start trembling and move in the direction of the order. It looked as if
she was moving by the sheer thought of Baba and was being controlled by His will.
Now Baba ordered the subject’s kundalinii to proceed towards the anahata
cakra. As the kundalinii left manipura, the subject fell on his back whilst still in the lotus
pose. The ‘humkara’ sound, ‘hum, hum’ was also emerging from him as a deep
sonorous sound.
Then Baba ordered the kundalinii to go to the vishuddha cakra and he became
very peaceful as the kundalinii entered the cakra. Now there was neither a vibration in
his body nor the sound of 'hum' from his mouth any more. There was a special kind of
halo and shine around his face.Now Baba ordered the kundalinii to reach the ajina cakra and when the
kundalinii reached there Baba looked at that sadhaka and told him to enjoy the bliss of
that state for some time.
Baba smiled at us and informed us, “This is the much-coveted state of
savikalpa samadhi. There is a feeling of intense bliss in this condition and this is also
called mukti. By regular practice of sadhana, with diligence and concentration, you too
can reach this state”.
During this time, Shri Chaterjee had remained absorbed as if in ecstasy for the
entire time. Presently Baba turned His attention to the subject, saying, “You have been
very fortunate to enjoy this. Now kundalinii, return to vishuddha cakra”.
At these words Shri Chatterjee began to weep and cry bitterly like a child.
Compassionate Baba said, “Very well, very well. Enjoy for some more time”.
Thus said Baba and remained quiet for some time. Then he ordered the
kundalinii to leave the ajina cakra and return to muladhara. The kundalinii obeyed
Baba’s orders instantly and the subject unwillingly came out of that blissful state and
returned to the awareness of the temporal. Laying his face in Baba’s lap he wept
bitterly for quite some time and most kind-hearted Baba caressed and patted him,
rubbed his back and continued to pacify and soothe him until he became calm and
peaceful. Baba also continued to reassure him that he would be given this kind of
samadhi again.
Shri Chatterjee was thus doubly blessed! He had first remained in savikalpa
samadhi for such a long time and then received the love and caressing from Baba in
His lap. Loved and caressed like an infant by Baba while he was lying in Baba’s lap, he
also received the assurance of another taste of ananda in the future. It is my prayer
that Baba may bless all His disciples in this manner.
When Shri Chatterjee became normal again Baba departed. For some distance
we followed Baba and when Baba took a turn to go to his residence, we left for our own
destinations.
Later on I asked my senior brother disciples, "Only two Yogeshvaras (masters
of yoga) have appeared on the earth so far, one of them was Shiva and the other
Krsna. Baba also called himself 'Yogeshvara' while he was ordering kulakundalinii. Is
He also the same?” But no one could reply satisfactorily.
Salutation to Baba who is the Death of Death
THE THIRD SUNDAY
st
The next Sunday, 21 November 1954 I again reached Jamalpur in the hope of
seeing more demonstrations.
On this third Sunday, Baba was gracious enough to demonstrate death and
revival of life in the body of another senior disciple brother. That day the number of
disciples was so great that the room was full to capacity. This was the same room
where on the previous Sunday Baba had been kind enough to demonstrate savikalpa
samadhi. On this day also all those sadhakas were present who had been there on the
previous Sunday. Besides them, some more sadhakas had come to see the
demonstration with Baba’s permission. There was a wooden cot in the room on whichBaba was to sit and in front of this there was a narrow passage up to the door. Apart
from this, there was no space even to set foot on the floor amongst the spectators, and
those seated there were scarcely able to move. Anticipation grew as everyone waited
for Baba to arrive.
Hands folded and wearing a smile that was at once gentle, appealing and
mischieveous, Baba entered the room. He spoke briefly with a few devotees and then
asked Shri Kishto Pal to come forward. The disciple obeyed and sat in front of Baba in
the lotus position, with his eyes closed. The onlookers waited expectantly.
Baba spoke in Bengali throughout the demonstration. Speaking in firm and
solemn tones, but without undue seremoniousness, Baba uttered a command: “Apana
vayu, rise, reach, and overcome saman vayu!”
Baba was commanding the vital air or energy of the subject. At once the subject
began gasping for air. He appeared quite uneasy. The onlookers glanced at one
another in surprise.
Baba further directed the vital energy of the sadhaka, “Rise and push the prana
vayu”.
Now the subject appeared very distressed. In a frenzy he started gasping for
breath. His breathing was deep and heavy. A murmur of alarm went through the
onlookers, but no-one dared to interfere. Everyone’s attention was riveted on the
drama unfolding before us.
Baba raised His voice a degree: “Prana vayu, cross the vyana vayu and strike
the udana vayu !”
Crash! The sadhaka fell on his back on the floor. The assembled people
gasped and a reflex tremor passed through the crowd. From the throat of the sadhaka
emerged a bubbling, gargling sound, and saliva foamed on his lips.
Baba’s voice rose another level: “Prana vayu, enter the udana vayu”.
Soon the bubbling sound stopped. The subject’s neck muscles started to relax
and his head fell to the right.
In the horrified silence that followed, Baba spoke calmly, almost
conversationally. Addressing a physician disciple who was in the crowd, Baba said,
“Doctor, examine this man. Is he clinically dead or alive?”
The doctor came forward and examined the subject thoroughly. He looked up
perplexed, and his normally crisp, professional tone faltered slightly as he reported his
finding. “Baba, there is no trace of life in any part of him”.
Our eyes fastened on Baba. Was everything under control? Did we hope He
might show some concern? But if He did, wouldn’t that mean something had gone
wrong? Nothing had gone wrong, everything was as He wished it to be. Only the
sadhaka was lying lifeless before us. What were we supposed to think? We trusted
Baba – but we wondered.
Baba smiled and said, “No ! He is not dead yet. There is life in him. People in
this state are mistakenly pronounced dead and sometimes even cremated”.Then Baba cast His gaze around the room, taking us all in, and said, “After this
demonstration is over, no-one is to tell him that I demonstrated death on him”.
A murmur of confusion arose. Would the subject himself not know what had
happened to him? Why would Baba give us such instructions? If the subject was still
alive, why would Baba call it death? If the subject were dead, why would Baba caution
us not to tell him afterwards – unless He was going to be restored to life?
Fear mingles with amazement as we struggled to comprehend what we were
seeing. Looking at the inert body of the subject, we wondered what would happen next.
Excitement and suspense mounted as we waited for Baba’s next move. The sadhaka
lay still on the floor. Seemingly interminable seconds passed.
Then, above the muttering of voices, Baba spoke once, “Prana vayu, leave the
body now!”
A pall of silence fell over the room. The subject’s head, unsupported, lolled
sickeningly to the right. In the ghastly stillness, Baba said quietly, “ Now he is truly and
completely dead”. Then He rose and left the room.
We followed Him to the next room, and Baba instructed that someone close the
door to the room where the dead sadhaka lay.
Though none of us guessed it at the time, the demonstration was a pivotal
episode in the playing out of Baba’s liila or plan for that sadhanka.
In the room adjoining the one where lay the lifeless form of Shri Kishto Pal,
Baba sat on the floor. He instructed Shri P. K. Chatterjee to massage His hands and
fingers. This seemed like and extraordinary request given the time and place. I
wondered about the reason for it, for surely Baba must have had some purpose other
than relaxation.
For some He chatted with us, and then He lay down on the blanket and asked
all of us to massage His hands and feet vigorously. We complied, but I was confused.
“What game is He playing?” I asked myself. “Something unusual must be
happening now. Baba was just fine a while ago, during the demonstration. I have never
seen Him like this”. My mind was abuzz with questions.
Baba asked Shri Chatterjee, “Does that room have any insects, such as ants?”
“Yes Baba, there are often a lot of large black ants inthere”.
“Make proper arrangements to protect the body from insects. Also, go and
examine the head of the body and inform me of its condition”.
When Shri Chatterjee returned, he reported that the head of the body was in the
same position as before. Baba closed His eyes for a moment. His body then became
entirely still and remained so for half and hour. During all this time, of course, we
continued to massage Him.
Then Baba got up and we followed Him to the room where the dead body of the
sadhaka lay, a testimony to the tranisory nature of all existence. Baba stood apart from
all the rest of us and instructed us not to touch Him until the demonstration was over.Baba stood near the head of the body. His toe touched the crown of the
sadhaka’s head, at the site of sahasrara cakra. He spoke to the dead body: “Open your
eyes”.
The eyes opened. We were thunderstruck
With His foot still touching the subject’s head, Baba asked, “Who are you?”
“I am Shyama Charan Lahiri” replied the body.
Startled because we had expected to hear Kishto Pal speak his own name, we
felt let down at first. Maybe the demonstration had wiped out his memory we thought. If
he had lost his mind, then the demonstration was not going to turn out as we had
hoped. Somehow he seemed to think he was one of modern India’s greatest yogis who
had passed away in 1895. We did not comprehend the subject’s confusion about his
identity.
“Why are you here?” asked Baba.
“I am the bodiless soul, and You have instructed me to protect this body”, came
the words from the sadhaka’s lips.
Then we understood: the dead body was the medium, and the entity speaking
through it was the bodiless soul of Shri Lahiri Mahasaya.
“Very well”, said Baba. “Now that you are here, do some work for us”.
“I am ready”.
Many a time on field walks with Baba I had besieged Him with questions about
the world we live in. My curiosity was endless, not only about this earth and its
neighbouring planets, but about the wise cosmos. Sometimes Baba replied at length,
but other times He cut it short, saying, “I will show you later”. Now, it seemed, ‘later’
had finally come.
“Go to the planet Mars”, commanded Baba.
A few seconds elapsed, and the bodiless soul replied,”Yes. I am there”.
“Is there any life there?”
“I do not recognise any life here”
“What do you see there?”
“It appears to be marshy land all around. Algae or weedlike growth seem to eb
present”.
“All right”, said Baba. “Now go to the earth’s moon”.
Shortly the bodiless soul responded, “I am there”.
“What do you see there?”
“Vast, dead deserts and mountains”.“Is there any life form?”
“No. There is no oxygen here”.
“Now go inside the land”, directed Baba. “Do you recognise any familiar
substances?”
“Yes. There is gold in the soil”.
These exchanges filled us with wonder. At no time since entering the room did
Baba break contact between His right toe and the sahasrara cakra of the subject. Soon
Baba instructed the bodiless soul to go to the planet Venus.
“Is there any life form on Venus?” asked Baba.
“Yes, but it is very different from ours. They are highly developed spiritually.
Their complexion is somewhat reddish. Even the most ordinary life form here is more
advanced than the spiritually advanced people of the earth”.
Baba then recalled him back to earth and directed him to a Himalayan cave,
where a yogii conversed with Baba through the bodiless soul. Baba also sent him on
missions to Washington D.C. and Moscow. For political reasons, it is better that I not
disclose details of those journeys, but within days we were to see events in world news
that we related directly to this incident.
With that, Baba brought the demonstration to a conclusion.
“Remember”, cautioned Baba, His eyes stern, “No-one is to tell this sadhaka
what has happened here”.
Solemnly, our gaze fixed on Him, we acknowledged His instructions with our
silence.
The eyes of the dead body closed as Baba gave the bodiless soul of Shyam
Charan Lahiri leave to depart. The mouth of the subject was open. The sight of the
corpse before us caused us some anxiety. The atmosphere was tense but quiet.
Baba broke the silence with a commanding voice: “Wherever may be the soul
and prana vayu of this person in the great Void, let it come down to this earth
immediately!”
After a moment, Baba said, “From the earth let it come to India. In India, let it
come to Bihar state. From Bihar let it come to Jamalpur town of Monghyr District and
then enter the Quarter Number 339EF of the Railway Colony of Rampur”.
As Baba directed the sadhaka’s soul to the very room in which we sat, the
suspense was phenomenal. We hardly dared to exhale. Not knowing what might
happen next, not wanting to miss a thing, we watched without blinking our eyes.
In the breathless silence, Baba’s voice ordered the soul and prana vayu to enter
the dead body of the disciple. Shri Kishto Pal opened his eyes. A cry of amazement
and joy broke from the mouths of the onlookers.
In rapid succession, Baba commanded all vayus to enter the body, and He
established balance amongst them. Then and only then, did Baba withdraw His toe
from touching the sahasrara cakra of the subject.Baba sat down on the wooden cot and uttered a mantra of some sort in the
direction of the subject. The sadhaka sat up. At once our tension fell from us and
melted away. The atmosphere lightened, and we all felt excited and happy.
The subject appeared very dull and absent-minded, as if he had just awakened
from a long sleep.
“Why do you look so distracted?” asked Baba.
“I feel thick-headed”, answered Kishto Pal, scanning the room with glazed eyes
and a bewildered expression. Baba had eradicated his memory of having gone through
the death process, and he had no idea of what he had just experienced.
“It’s all right”, Baba assured him. “Do not take any solid food tonight. Just have
a glass of hot milk before going to bed. You will feel better by morning”.
At the end of this demonstration, two questions plagued my mind. First, why
was this particular person chosen for the demonstration? Second, what happened to
Baba when He left the dead body and went into the adjoining room, and why did He
ask us all to massage Him vigorously?
The demonstration was over, and the crown dispersed. When Baba got up and
left for His home, some of us followed Him. On the way, one of the disciples told me
that he knew the sadhaka who had been the subject of the demonstration. He said,
“This morning when I went to Baba’s house, Shri Kishto Pal was already there. Baba
was very angry with him, and He severely scolded and punished him in front of me.
Then Baba told him to leave and to come to the demonstration in the evening”.
Animated by curiosity, I encouraged him to continue. He knew something that
might reveal the answer to my first question.
“When he left Baba’s house, Baba told me, ‘I had forbidden him to marry, but he
got married anyway. He has a very short life, and that is why I told him not to marry. He
did not listen to me and has now created problems for himself and his family’. Then I
knew why Baba was angry with him”.
What did this tell me? I thought a moment – and there it was ! In the course of
the demonstration, Baba had subjected this disciple to death in a controlled
environment a the right moment in time. Thus had Baba had fulfilled his samskara of
death, and gave him new life again for his won sake and that of his family. To facilitate
in this discharge of his samskaras, Baba had also given him severe punishment that
same morning. Further evidence that the subject for this demonstration was specifically
chosen was the fact that he was not a resident of Jamalpur. Baba had called him all the
way from Calcutta to give him new life.
The following day I went to Baba’s house. I did my sastaunga pranam and
respectfully stated that I had some questions about the demonstration.
Baba said,”I will not answer any questions about the demonstration”.
“Fine”, I said, “But I have a question about You, not the demonstration”.
Baba chuckled. “All right. I will allow that”.
“What happened to You after You left the dead body of the subject and went tothe next room? Why were You so quiet when You lay down and why did You ask us to
massage You vigorously?”
Smiling, Baba asked, “Have you never seen me like that?”
“No”, I replied.
“My mind was withdrawing into the state of nirvikalpa samadhi”. He explained.
“If I allowed that to happen, it might have taken me a few hours to come back to the
normal conscious state, and there was a possibility of the decomposition of the
subject’s dead body. Your vigorous massage disturbed me enough so that I did not
enter nirvikalpa samadhi”.
After these demonstrations when I next went for Baba's darshan, Baba said in
somewhat a serious mood, "You had a strong desire to see these demonstrations. I
have therefore shown them. In future if you would like to see I would only show one
demonstration: when I would say, ‘the earth exists’, the earth will remain, and when I
would say, ‘the earth does not exist' neither the earth would be there nor you nor I will
remain”.
I said, "Baba it does not matter whether I remain or not, but Your existence on
the earth is so much necessary. The whole creation will be blessed by Your presence”.
Baba again said, "Your curiosity and eagerness had increased so much that
these demonstrations had to be shown. People take them to be miracles; which is not
good”.
It is so true. I had been in the habit of questioning Baba on such matters all the
time. By this I understood that Baba meant that I should no longer continue with such
questions. I, therefore, never asked such questions again.
THE FOURTH SUNDAY
It had been announced on the third Sunday of November 1954 that another
demonstration would take place on the final Sunday of the month, November 28th.
Once again the disciples gathered at Railway Quarter Number 339EF, arriving well in
advance of Baba’s expected arrival. As usual, Baba was punctual. We did sastaunga
pranam and Baba blessed us.
For the third time, Baba called upon Shri P. K. Chatterjee as His subject. Shri
Chatterjee sat asw before before Baba in the lotus position, and Baba asked him to
concentrate on his iista cakra.
Baba then addressed the kundalinii: “I Yogeshvar Anandamurti, order you to
leave Muladhara and go to svadhisthana cakra”.
The kundalinii obeyed Baba’s command as we saw by observing the physical
changes in the subject. Baba guided the kundalinii upward to manipura, anahata,
vishuddha and ajina cakras, as He had done with this subject on November 14th. We
witnessed the same subtle yet profound transformations in the subject’s physical
appearance as the kundalinii rose.
Now Baba directed the kundalinii to the highest cakra, saharara. The subject
became calm and peaceful, and his face shone with a halo-like brightness.“What you see in this subject”, said Baba, “is the state of nirvikalpa samadhi,
the highest possible realisation of Self that one can achieve”.
We looked on in wonder, each with his own private thoughts, contemplating the
bliss our brother disciple was experiencing.
Baba added, “Establishment in this stage is the attainment of moksa (final
liberation) and it is the stage of nirguna Brahma (unqualified consciousness).
Baba allowed the subject to remain in that state of spiritual bliss for about five
minutes. Then He cpommanded the kundalinii to return to ajina cakra, where it
remained while Baba once more permitted the subject to enjoy his blissful state.
When Baba uttered the command that would move the kundalinii to vishuddha
cakra, the subject began to cry bitterly, imploring Baba to let him stay longer in that
stage. Compassionate Baba afforded him a few more minutes in savikalpa samadhi.
At Baba’s word, the kundalinii again commenced it’s descent to vishuddha
cakra. The subject began crying even more bitterly than before, begging Baba to let
him remain where he had been. His desperate pleas so moved Baba that He agreed,
saying, “all right, kundalinii, stay at ajina cakra for a while and let him enjoy divine
bliss”.
While the subject continued in his ecstatic condition, Baba explained to us various
philosophical technicalities of this stage of samadhi.
After a few more minutes, Baba spoke to the kundalinii to guide it to vishuddha
cakra. But the subject had by now become addicted to bliss. He began to protest
frantically. He wept and begged and pleaded. This time Baba responded by getting a
little tough. In a voice one might use to scold a disobedient pup, He commanded, “Get
down now, you rascal!”
Instantly the kundalinii returned all the way to muladhara cakra.
Baba’s rough language and tone astonished me. In all the literature I had read,
the great yogiis and saints never failed to address the kundalinii with the greatest
respect, saying, ‘mother kundalinii’ in a deferential manner. I realized that Baba was a
great personality whose powers went beyond those of the great yogis and saints.
Whereas others appeased the kundalinii and sought its cooperation in their
realizations, baba had total control of it. It was at Baba’s disposal any time He chose to
command it.
The subject was now in a state of unspeakable grief. His kundalinii having
returned to muladhara cakra, his moments of bliss had passed and left him shaken and
bereft. The sudden movement of the kundalinii from ajina to muladhara cakra was like
a a drop in body temperature from 108 degrees to 94 degrees. The subject cried
inconsolably, like a child without regard to surroundings, his age, station or the
presence of others. Laying his head in Baba’s lap, he wept for a long time. Baba
soothed and consoled him until he was quiet.
Thus it was that Baba permitted us to see a real-life, practical demonstration of
nirvikalpa samadhi, the final aim of all yogis. In so doing, He also fulfilled His promise
of two weeks earlier to grant Shrii P.K. Chatterjee another opportunity to experience
spiritual bliss. Some day in the future, humanity may write about the bright disciples of
Baba in golden letters. Along with those accomplished disciples were disciples like me,ordinary disciples with limited intellect. But in His compassion Baba loved us all
equally. Side by side like brothers, all disciples basked in His divine love.
When the demonstration was finished, I said, “Baba, when You command the
kundalinii to move from one cakra to another, it appears that various changes occur in
the subject’s body”.
“Yes”, replied Baba, “Various signs will appear in the sadhakas body when the
kundalinii moves up or down through the cakras. The kundalinii can have different
ways of motion, and different symptoms will appear accordingly”.
Baba described the many kinds of movement of the kundalinii and their
manifestations in the body. To the subject, the movements may feel like those of a
snalke, or of an insect such as ant, or of a frog making a sudden leap.
These demonstrations increased our faith and devotion towards Baba. All these
demonstrations took place in one quarter of the railway colony. Devotees now realised
to some extent, that the One whom it takes lifetimes of penance to understand and to
realise, has from His own mouth gives His own introduction in such a simple manner.
Sitting at Baba's feet we saw that to Him the mastery over life and death were
but child’s play. We saw with our own eyes people enter savikalpa and nirvikalpa
samadhi in a trice. The burning of accumulated samskaras (karma), mukti (salvation)
and moksa (complete freedom from earthly bondages) came with the stir of His
thought-waves. We saw voyages to stars and planets and the observation of conditions
there being made without the slightest difficulty. News from every corner of the world
and knowledge of circumstances everywhere, these wonders were to Him as common
as the grass under our feet. Baba is so omnipotent.
