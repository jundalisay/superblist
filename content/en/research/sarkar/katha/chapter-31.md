Shri R. Prasad was the great friend of Shri Jitendra Tyagi, mentioned earlier.

He was a disciple of Baba’s who was externally, fashionably dressed and appeared very formal, but inwardly was extremely soft, kind and full of devotion. 

<!-- Those who did not know him very well were likely to form an impression only
on the basis of his outer looks, but people with such a rich character are hard to find. I
am talking of  -->

When I reached Delhi for my training course, I came to know that Shri R. Prasad had detected a very important and big smuggling case, which he said had only been possible by the grace of Baba. When I arrived in Delhi, the case was the talk of
everyone in the whole Ministry of Finance of the Government of India. It was such a
daring and courageous feat that it was really the talk of the town in Delhi. Many highly
placed foreigners were involved. 

One of them was a Cuban citizen and another belonged to a very distinguished family from America. Being also in the Customs and Excise Department, I also wanted to know more details. There were a lot of stories
about how the group had been detected and the manner in which it was caught.

Everyone used to add something of his own as if he were witness to the whole drama.

In fact, the story had acquired the status of a detective novel.

Shri R. Prasad was Collector, Central Customs and Excise for Delhi in those days. He was one of the boldest most daring and experienced Collectors, with a lot of initiative, dash and charisma. The Collector’s post of Delhi was itself a very prestigious one.

His personality was like a coconut fruit, very hard shell outside but very soft and
sweet on the inside. His outward behaviour was very serious, stiff, ultra-modern and full
of discipline. People always gained this impression if they did not know him intimately.
All those who came even slightly close to him realised that he was very truthful,
sensitive, compassionate, simple and full of the milk of devotion. These qualities of his
nature had made him very dear to Baba.

One day he had to take a class in the departmental training course I was
attending. In that class, the trainees were mostly gazetted officers of the department
and every one requested him to tell about this famous smuggling case.
He said that the customs officers in Bombay had viewed the movement of two
foreigners with suspicion and so started keeping an eye on them. These two persons
were seen in Bombay with a Frenchman of dubious reputation who was also in
Bombay in those days. Suddenly both of them left for Delhi by plane and the Bombay
Customs informed Prasadji about them by phone.
Shrii R. Prasad instructed his Preventive Superintendent to keep a watch on
these two characters and he was present at the airport when they arrived from
Bombay. After this, the two men checked in at the Ashoka Hotel, the biggest one in
Delhi in those days.

Prasadji was informed that there was a telephone in their room. He contacted
the telephone authorities to request them to contact him as soon as they made orreceived any call. Almost immediately, the phone rang and Shri Prasad learnt that a
man in Bombay was informing one of the other men that a packet was being brought
by an air-hostess and would deliver it to them at 10 p.m. at their hotel.
With this tip Shri Prasad thought of Baba and appointed another Prevention
Officer to keep a watch on this airhostess. Soon after, the Collector of Customs rang
Prasadji to inform him that a letter from one of the men had been intercepted by
customs. This informed his relatives in America that he was about to earn about a
hundred thousand dollars and would return soon to America. After receiving this
information, Prasadji came to the conclusion that both these foreigners were
smugglers.

That night Prasadji did not go home, he sat the whole night by the telephone in
his office. He continued to remember Baba and make plans to catch those foreigners
red-handed. At about 10 p.m. the Prevention Officer rang up from the airport to say that
the airhostess had arrived and was making a call from the airport.
Prasadji instructed that a close watch be kept on this woman. Meanwhile, his
telephone was connected to the Ashoka Hotel and he listened to the conversation
between the two men and the air-hostess. She was telling them that the product had
arrived, and she was going to bring it to them at the hotel. The two men went to meet
her for dinner and drinks at a restaurant at the hotel. When she arrived they took the
packet from her. Prasadji kept awake for the reports from the Prevention Officers, and
after this they were even more alert.

The airhostess left the hotel at about 2 a.m.

The next day, at about nine in the morning, the two men left the hote,hired a car
and went towards Old Delhi. The Prevention Officers followed them in another car. The
men went to the railway junction and began to make enquiries at the goods-shed there
and then appeared worried. Seeing them disturbed, one of the Prevention Officers
enquired from the clerks at the goods-shed as to the subject of their enquiry. He was
informed that they had booked their car from Bombay which was to arrive in Delhi on a
passenger train. That train had derailed some four of five stations back and therefore
would now be late. It was scheduled to reach Delhi by eleven a.m., but it was now likely
to only arrive in the afternoon.

This was new information, and the Prevention Officers a passed it on to the
Collector, Shri Prasadji. He reiterated his instructions to keep a close watch on them.
The two men returned to the hotel looking upset and from there they made several
enquiries from the goods-shed during the afternoon. Following this development,
Prasadji instructed his officers that after the men took delivery of the vehicle from the
train, the watch on them should be continued.

When the train reached Delhi Station, the foreigners took delivery of the car
very quickly, and brought it to the hotel. They paid off their bills and boarded the car
with their luggage. This was a new Lincoln car, and they were soon driving it very fast,
even in the city. It was therefore difficult for the Prevention Officers to follow them in
their staff jeep. The two men left Delhi and proceeded along the Punjab Road. Now the
Prevention Officers contacted Prasadji by phone and informed him that it was no longer
possible to follow them in the staff car, as the foreign car was doing 80 to 90 miles per
hour, so Prasadji recalled the Officers.Salutation To Baba The Great Barge To Cross The Ocean Of
Becomings

## THE SMUGGLERS UNMASKED

The suspicions of Prasadji were further stimulated by this flight of the foreigners. He instructed the police in Delhi, Punjab and Harayana to be vigilant and watch the direction in which the car was moving. He also gave a physical description of
the driver. By the grace of Baba, all the Police Officers were prepared, and a few hours
later, the Punjab police informed Prasadji that the car was travelling at great speed
towards Jallandhar.

Shri R. Prasad instructed that the car should be allowed to proceed. Now it was
clear that the car was moving towards Pakistan so his plan was that the smugglers
should be caught at the last border post along with the smuggled goods. He phoned
the customs officer at the Atari check-post on the border. He instructed the police at the
check-post that the car and its foreign occupants must be allowed to proceed only after
a thorough search and after obtaining clear instructions from him.
About fifteen to twenty minutes before sunset these two men reached Atari
checkpost in a great hurry to cross the check post before sundown. They were
therefore both pressuring and requesting the officers at the check-post to check them
quickly and allow them to cross the border. Border crossings were only permitted until
sunset, so the check-post in-charge was trying to delay them by seeing that the
customs checking proceeded slowly until after sunset and they could be legally delayed
until the following day.

In this way, checking the men’s documents was delayed and it was already
sunset. Now with the help of the police, this car was placed in the custody of the
customs officers and arrangements were made for the foreigners to stay at the check-
post itself. They could not commence the search that evening and it was decided that
search would be begun the next morning.
On specific instructions from Prasadji, the customs officers had already taken
the declaration of the two men and this news was conveyed to Prasadji by telephone.
Now Prasadji sent a group of Prevention Officers from the Head Office to Atari so that
the search could be conducted thoroughly.
That night also Prasadji stayed in his office all night. So far He felt that Baba
had helped him at every step, but now it was a difficult test, as full success had not
been achieved. And now difficulties began to increase. But like a good spiritual soldier
and disciple of Baba, Prasadji continued to remain firm and unperturbed. So great was
his devotion, that although the tests were severe, he did not forget Baba for a moment.
Why then should victory not be his?

The two men threatened to make a complaint to the Ministry, but the customs
officers remained firm in their stand. In the meantime, both of them contacted their
respective embassies and complained about the treatment of the officers and the
representatives of the embassies contacted the Foreign Ministry.
The results of the search of the car were also sent to Prasadji. In the morning
both the foreigners had been personally searched and nothing was found. Then their
luggage and car was searched again. Even then nothing incriminating was found. This
also was conveyed to Prasadji.Here began a highly delicate situation and the final test of Prasad’s courage
and faith. But Prasadji faith in Baba was unbounded and it was not to be shaken by
small events like this, so he continued to advance further remembering Baba all the
time and not caring about the pressures and failures which were building up in the
situation. This is the first pre requisite for success.

Prasadji told his officers that it was impossible that the two men do not have
some contraband on them. He therefore, ordered that the Chief Engineer of Punjab
Roadways Corporation should examine the car for any secret chambers.
The engineer examined the car and gave a certificate in writing that there was
no secret chamber in the car. In the meanwhile, the customs officers also asked a
private engineer to examine the car and he also certified that there was no secret
chamber. Again this information was conveyed to Prasadji.

Most officers would have given up at this stage, when two independent
technical authorities had come to a negative conclusion. But Prasadji was not prepared
to believe that there was no chamber in the car. He therefore instructed that every part
of the car should be measured and where two parts met the distance between them
should be careful examined.

In the meantime, threatening instructions were being received from both the
Ministry of External Affairs and the Ministry of Finance about the non-release of these
two foreigners by the customs check-post. But Prasadji felt he was being guided by
Baba and he continued the search in spite of all adverse reports so far. This was also
communicated to the then Prime Minister and he ordered that his secretary should
inform Prasadji that this was a matter of international law and international relationship
and as nothing incriminating was found in spite of best efforts, those people should be
allowed to proceed on their journey. The Prime Minister’s instructions were conveyed in
threatening language to Prasadji his secretary.

But Shrii Prasad was also a lion-hearted Collector, not to be intimidated by such
threats from the highest quarter in the country. He continued to feel that he was being
guided and blessed by Baba.

He replied to the Secretary to the PM, “I know if I fail to detect and establish any
case against them I shall be destroyed, but it does not mean they are not smugglers.
There may be a complete bankruptcy of our intelligence that we have so far not
succeeded in finding the loot. But I am sure they are definitely carrying it with them.”


I have given the above reply of Prasadji, but the Lord does not disappoint his
devotees. By the grace of Baba the news came by phone that very evening that while
checking the measurements between different parts of the car, the secret chamber and
the hidden treasure had been found. It had gold bars worth one million rupees and
Indian currency worth a similar amount.
Prasadji again remembered Baba and instructed his Prevention Officers to
arrest both the men, to seize the car and the treasure, and keep it in the custody of
armed police.
The news of this arrest was to be kept secret until Prasadji reached Atari. After
issuing these instructions he left for the airport without informing anyone, took a plane
for Amritsar taking the Assistant Customs Collector with him and reached Atari thesame night. There he gathered all the facts from his Prevention Officers and called a
press conference and released all the news about the search and seizure of the hidden
treasure. This news spread like wild fire and every morning paper gave it prominence
in their next morning issue.
Prasadji had spent three days and nights awake in his office receiving news
and issuing instructions. Even his office came to know of his presence at the check-
post only through the morning newspapers and here was the irony: those very people
who were threatening him the day before, now began to congratulate him on his
success. When the Prime Minister’s secretary rang to convey the PM’s congratulations,
he said, “If I were the PM I would have given the Victoria Cross to these Customs
Officers!”
Then Prasadji told us about the secret chamber.
When the Prevention Officers were measuring the distance between different
parts they could not explain the distance between different parts they could not explain
the distance between the back seat and the boot of the car, which was about one foot
more than necessary. Finding no justification for this gap, they removed the back seat
and saw square plates fixed in the iron sheet. These plates were covered with wool.
When this wool was removed, both the men began to object that the car was being
damaged. Paying no heed to their objections, they continued the search and
discovered a small hole. By thrusting a small wire inside, they found that the square
plates could be moved. After some time that plate gave way and then they reached the
treasure concealed by the foreigners for which they were searching. This cavity was
about one foot deep and it contained one million rupees in Indian currency, which could
be sold at a high premium in Pakistan.
On further scrutiny and questioning they discovered the second secret chamber
also, which contained the gold bars. There were no further secret chambers in the car.
These secret chambers were constructed in France, by the American. The currency
notes and the gold bars were placed in custody at Bombay.
After reciting the whole event, Prasadji said, “With firm and implicit faith in the
Almighty as my supreme guide, I gave this case my special attention, as soon as these
men left Delhi in such haste for Atari. I did not care for the threats I was getting from
the highest executive of the country as the Almighty was with me.”
This case went on for some time and every one who was involved in any
capacity whether as a pleader or guarantor was imprisoned. Both the accused were
convicted and by the grace of Baba these punishments were upheld up to the Supreme
Court.

Throughout the run of this case Prasadji was pressurised and threatened from
many quarters, but having firm faith in Baba he stood like a rock in all difficult
circumstances and was successful at every step. He had been in Ananda Marga only
for two years by then, but his faith in Baba had matured to this inimitable and
appreciable extent.

R. PRASAD AND HIS FAMILY
R. Prasad had been a busy man all his life. While in Delhi he became so busy
that he hardly got any time to meet his relatives and friends. Even so he remembered
Baba. There was no flaw in his devotion. Even in the busiest period, he spared time for
the work of the Marga and to spread its ideology. He was in fact, totally dedicated to
the mission. After his retirement he was like a whole-time worker of the Marga.Shrii R. Prasad belonged to Bareilly in Uttar Pradesh. His family is one of the
most prosperous and cultured ones in this state. About half the land and property of
modern Bareilly belongs to his family. His respected father was a Congress leader of
the status of Pandit Motilal Nehru and his uncle was Sir Kishan Prasad I.C.S. who was
one of the earliest Indian entrants in this service and a famous administrator of his
times. All his relatives are highly placed in government service at the centre or in the
state. The relations between his family and the Nehru family were quite close.
His revered mother who died recently was always respected by Pandit
Jawaharlal Nehru and his daughter Smt. Indira Gandhi, both of whom used to touch
her feet.
His father was very close to Swami Vivekanandaji also. Swamiji had actually
stayed with them for quite some time. He had vast experience of working in banks,
excise, customs and in the police at high positions and had immense vitality.
During the Emergency when Ananda Marga was banned, Shrii Prasad was
interned in Tihar Jail in Delhi, where he used to send those who violated the excise and
customs laws.
Prasadji was much attached to his mother and used to feel very disturbed when
he noticed any anxiety in his mother’s face. After his arrest, his mother met the Prime
Minister who assured her that if Mr. Prasad denied that he is a Margii, he would be
instantly released from prison. But Prasadji rejected this offer of the PM saying that he
cannot even think in those terms. This was one of those rare occasions when he did
not agree to his mother's request.
Later it was the irony of fate that Smt. Indira Gandhi and her son had to live in
the same Tihar jail during the Janata Regime after the Emergency.
Salutations to Baba Who Eliminated Sorrows Born Of Old Age
And Birth

PRASADJI’S LAST YEARS

In the latter half of 1980 Prasadji had gone to Harayana on some work for the
Marga and a stroke and fell unconscious on his return journey. He later said that even
in that condition he had the image of Baba clear and divine on his mental plate. He was
brought to Delhi by his travelling companion and admitted to one of the best hospitals.
He was looked after very well and information about his illness reached Baba in
Calcutta the same night. Even when he regained consciousness he said he was still
thinking of Baba. He had a quick recovery and was soon released from the hospital.
Some time after his stroke, Baba called Prasadji to Calcutta. I had also gone at
that to see His botanical garden. This was Prasadji’s first darshan of Baba after his
sickness. We were staying in the same room and I found that he had become quite
weak and required some support to get around. Even then his courage was unbroken.
Every day, morning and evening, he would go to Baba’s residence, Madhu
Malancha, and felt uplifted whenever he saw Baba. Many a time he also went for field
walk, sitting along-side Baba in the car.

After a week’s stay in Calcutta he was preparing to return to Delhi and on the
eve of his departure he met Baba and I was fortunate to be with him also.When Baba returned from his walk, he stopped in front of us. Prasadji informed
Baba that he was returning to Delhi the next morning and that his son was insisting on
his going to Germany for treatment. Baba took his hands in his own and encouraged
him to go to Germany. He also said that the German climate at that time would suit his
health and he should leave for Germany as soon as possible.
That evening, Baba kept Prasadji’s hands in His own the whole time He was
talking with him talked to him in an extremely kind and patient way. Baba told him many
things about Germany in detail.
On our way back from Madhu Malancha I noted that Prasadji was walking with
much more strength and abandon. I was walking behind him silently. His gait reminded
me of his 1947-48 days. For some time I watched to see if this was a temporary or
permanent change. When I found that the change in his gait was natural and
permanent, I could not restrain myself and commented, “You seem to have regained
your vitality of 1947-48.”

He laughed heartily at my remark and agreed that he was also feeling like that.
He said, “Baba has cured me completely and I am feeling in perfect health.”
I said, “Baba could not bear to see you in pain and by keeping your hands in his
for five minutes he has removed all your illness.”
Prasadji also agreed with me. The next morning I accompanied him as far as
Patna, on his return journey to Delhi.

Prasadji who had spent a life of luxury and power become an example of
simplicity and ascetic purity in his later life.. He was like a sannyasi in normal dress. He
was blessed with undying faith, devotion, attachment and surrender to Baba. I came to
know belatedly in July 1983 that Prasadji died on 5th January 1983 at eight in the
evening. I pray to Baba that his soul may rest in eternal peace and may he attain his
desideratum.
