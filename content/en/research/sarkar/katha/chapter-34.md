I was fortunate enough to attend my first DMC celebrated on the occasion of Ananda Purnima is 1958. By the grace of Baba the Margiis of Ranchi celebrated the first Ananda Purnima DMC on 12th May 1958.

I had digressed from the subject earlier by describing my mother’s illness. I therefore, could not relate the specialties of
this DMC. On the day of the DMC when at about nine is the morning Baba arrived for the general darshan and was seated
in His chair, some from amongst the devotees expressed a desire to dance before Baba. So far, there used to be music at
the time of general darshan but there was no dance.

The DMC that was observed just before this one had been in Bengal and there Baba had promoted a desire to dance in devotion. Now, therefore DMC also began to have dance by some. Therefore when some devotees expressed a desire to dance
those who were not present in the previous DMC in Bengal also became keen to
observe devotional dance and they also joined in the request.

THE INTRODUCTION OF LALIITA MARMIIKA KIIRTAN

Baba was pleased at the eagerness of the devotees and He said, “dance is not possible without music, both are intimately related”.

Then Acarya Deep Narayanji began to sing a song. He kept singing. After sometime his eyes began to close as he was singing and gradually he began to raise himself in a dancing pose. Now gradually his feet began to dance and he began
dancing in deep devotional ecstasy. 

As his dance became moving, others also began to dance with him.

Shrii Bindeshwariji was also amongst those who were dancing. He was dancing in great ecstasy utterly unmindful of this body or mid. Even otherwise he always used to remain in Baba bhava, but when he was present before Baba, his devotion became as strong as a tide in full moon night and he used to attain full Baba bhava.

Although the dance of these devotees was not systematic, yet there was excess of devotion, in their movements. It was so inspiring and pleasing to see them dance. Most of the devotees who were dancing had a divine effulgence and great happiness on their faces.

Meanwhile a senior devotee who was also an acarya, lost all consciousness while dancing and lay down on the floor in that state. For some time, he lay still and thereafter he began to crawl like a leech and intervened himself between Baba’s feet.
Merciful Baba drew him near and now he sat up.

Baba began to pat his back and with Baba’s hand still on his back, he began to raise himself on his knees and addressed
us.“Oh! Residents of the earth stay in ananda!”

As he said this Baba struck his forehead with the palm of His hand and now he became quiet and put his head in Baba’s lap and sat quietly, while the other devotees were still dancing. Baba rose quietly from his chair and retired into His room.
Baba was amidst us for about 45 minutes and in this period everyone
was immersed in a state of bliss.

Those who could not dance were also lost while sitting in the devotional atmosphere. After Baba left, the acarya whose back Baba had patted, sat on Baba’s chair. Some devotees did not like this and they greatly objected
to this.

But the acarya who sat on Baba’s seat heard this objection and said, “At this moment I am Anandamurti”, and having said this he fell silent.

Acarya Deep Narayanji was still singing and dancing in great devotion. It appeared that every limb of his body was dancing. Others were also dancing with him. 

Even after Baba left this devotional atmosphere, dancing and singing continued up to noon. After that all Margiis joined in the collective feast. The one who was sitting in Baba’s chair was in full Brahma bhava or Baba bhava therefore was unable to walk by himself.

Therefore two brother disciples supported him and brought him to the dining place and he was seated for lunch by my side. He was not taking any food although food had been served to him. He was sitting quiet and peaceful. After my repeated
persuasion he lifted some rice from his plate and begun to feed me with the same.
There after he gave me water to drink. I did not understand at all and asked why he
was feeding and making me drink water. Now, he beckoned towards himself. Then I
followed that I have to feed him with my hand he was saying that the same Almighty
that is me and he was food also, and how could he eat the food?
As I was trying to make him understand, someone came along with
Bindeshwariji before me. He was also in full Baba bhava. He saw me, stopped there
and began to take his food out of the plate that was in front of me, when the server saw
this even though I objected, he served more food in my plate. By the grace of God, it
was enough for me that I could feed these two persons in ecstasy. With Bindeshwariji
also thrown in I was not at all bothered about my own food, my whole anxiety was also
how to feed these two devotees. The gentleman who bought them to me left after he
had entrusted them to my care.
The first gentleman who was in Baba bhava did not eat anything at all.
Bindeshwariji did take something and also tried to feed the other gentleman. But he too
did not succeed here. When all had finished taking food. I got these two gentleman
cleaned and took them to the place where they were staying. They both remained in
perfect Brahma bhava throughout.

In 1958 on the occasion of the pious day of Ananda Purnima on 3 May 1958 in
the evening the Margiis of Muzaffarpur Published a magazine called “Prabhat” which
represented progressive ideas. The editor of this magazine Shrii Shashi Rainjanji
presented this paper to Baba on 12th May 1958 at Ranchi at the time of the DMC Baba
blessed the paper thus:
“For the good of all
For the happiness of all
Let your “Prabhat “ attain a long life".Later in September 1958, the name of this magazine was changed to “Jeevan
Bharati” It aimed at converting the long dark night of man’s mind into a bright morning
light.
In the evening we were again fortunate to have the blissful darshan of Baba and
to hear His voice which was concentrated attention drinking sweet like nectar.
The subject of the discourse was “Sadhana”. Every devotee had turned his
mind inwards and was listening to Baba with their eyes fixed on the beauty of Baba’s
divine effulgent face. During this DMC Baba’s body looked white like camphor and
every part of His physique had tremendous attraction in its sweetness.
Every on became so absorbed in devotion and that we lost the count of time
when Baba’s speech came to an end. The darshan of Baba and listening to his voice
used to last up to the next DMC. After DMC all Margiis went to their respective places
absorbed in Baba’s thought. That day Baba was also to leave for Jamalpur.
Salutations to Baba Who Destroys the Anguish of Those who
are Burning with Pain


HOW COMPLETE SURRENDER DESTROYS UNWORTHY DESIRES

The tests to which Baba puts us are extraordinary. Sometimes they are such that one hesitates to relate them to anyone. But now that I am writing my autobiography as a sadhaka, I shall relate my experience in this regard also.

About a month after return from Ranchi DMC, I developed a strong longing to eat the meat of the waterfowl. For many days I suppressed this desire by remembering Baba, but any desire continued to become stronger and stronger.
At last one day. 

I told my domestic servant and aunt at the time of lunch that I would like to have a non-vegetarian dinner that day. I ordered this and want to my office.

After reaching office the first thing I did was to write a letter to Baba on this subject stating that when my desire became uncontrollable I have asked my domestic servant to prepare a non-vegetarian meal for me.

Everyone in the family was surprised to my desire for non-vegetarian food. But no one raised an objection. Now it appeared that without Baba’s special grace this desire of mine was not going to disappear. I there fore recalled a sloka from the Giita, which states the following:

“Highly dejected and depressed – quite confused about my own Dharma, I offer
myself as your disciple, Raise me oh Lord! and teach me that which is for my ultimate
good”.
By night I had almost forgotten that I had ordered non-vegetarian meals for
myself for that night. When I was served with non-vegetarian food I recollected that I
had ordered this food for myself. I do not know why I did not even have a desire to look
at that food. I told my domestic assistant to remove that dish from my plate and bring
the same food for me which had been prepared for my wife and my aunt, as both of
them were vegetarians.
As long as I relied on my mental power to suppress my desire, these desires
continued to become stronger. But when I surrendered myself to the will of Babathrough my letter, in fact as soon as the letter was posted, this desire of mine
disappeared, and I almost forgot about non-vegetarian food.
Had my domestic assistant not brought the non-vegetarian dish before me, I
would have never, perhaps recollected that this desire had became strong in me.
Posting that letter to Baba had a miraculous effect on me and after that day up till now,
by Baba’s grace, I have never had a desire to eat meat. I have felt that desires rise and
disappear just at the instance of Baba. So compassionate is my Lord Baba.
