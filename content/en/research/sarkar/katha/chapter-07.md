My former boss, Ajit Singh, was attempting to get me demoted and himself promoted once more by writing to government officials in Delhi. 

He was of the firm conviction that his demotion was due to me, although this was far from true. He did not
succeed in getting promoted; but he did succeed in getting me demoted. I received
information in September 1954 that orders of my demotion had been passed in Delhi
although formal orders were yet to be issued.

I have always been attached to the prestige of my status. I therefore felt restless to save my prestige. I was not able to get leave and go to Baba, therefore I wrote a letter about my problems to Baba. I also wrote in the letter that I would prefer
death to demotion and was least prepared to face a downfall in my rank.

When Baba received my letter He sent my relative and long-time friend Bindeshwariji, who was also a recent initiate, to find me in Begusarai. At the time however, I was in Khagaria for some work, but Bindeshwariji searched for me and
found me there. He delivered Baba's message to me and immediately returned to
Jamalpur.

Baba's instructions were, “He was given two mantras. He makes use of one, but not the other at all. He should be told to use the other one also and so the order of demotion will not move further”.

At this I immediately remembered the other mantra and began to follow the instructions in this regard. Meanwhile I also got leave and reached Baba's lotus feet in Jamalpur.

At first Baba scolded me on my writing about my death. “You consider death to
be a plaything”. Then He explained how promotion and demotion are part of a service
career and one should not be perturbed at these. He also told that attachment to the
status of a post is wrong. He advised me that it would be in my interest to accept the
demotion that was coming.
I was not at all ready to accept this situation. I enquired also what wrong I had
done to deserve this punishment. Baba said 'I know that you have done nothing in this
life to suffer a demotion in status. However this is a samskara of your past life and it
would be best to suffer it. Even so, I was not ready to accept it.
Baba then began to coax me in the same manner as parents do when a child
begins to insist on something and during this process Baba said, "All right Nagina - let
this be; that demotion will come when you want it".
I thought over Baba's words for sometime and then it came to my mind that
everyone in this world wants to rise. No one ever wants demotion. Baba is leaving me
with the option of my own demotion - which is it shall come when I want it and will not
come in case I do not want it. Therefore why should I think of demotion at all? I thought
that it was a good boon and why should I not accept it.
I told Baba, "I am ready for it".
Baba immediately said, “Let it be so”.I felt happy and went for a walk with Baba that evening.
Salutations to Baba the Great Protector of Protectors!
MAINJU IS BROUGHT BACK FROM THE DEAD
My residence in Begusarai was in a lane. One had to go about twenty-five yards
from the main road, before one reached my second story residence. After about a
month, on a holiday, after getting ready, I walked down my stairs and came to the lane
and walked a little to go to Baba - when I suddenly heard the cry of a child. When I
turned back I saw that my domestic servant was trying to console my little daughter
Mainju in his lap. She had started crawling at that time.
I turned back and enquired what had happened, and was told that I had
forgotten to close the small gate at the top of the stairs. Mainju had been silently
following me on her knees and when she tried to follow me onto the stairs, she toppled
and fell down about ten or twelve steps into the lane. Although she was not seriously
injured she was shocked by the fall. It took time before she stopped crying and
meanwhile I missed the train. The next train left in the afternoon and I took that one to
reach Jamalpur.
In the evening when I reached Baba's place, I did my pranam and accompanied
Him on His walk. On the way, Baba said, "I expected you here in the morning". I replied
"Yes Baba, I started to take the 10 a.m. train, but as my young daughter fell, I missed
that train and hence came here by the next train. Baba was somewhat pained to her
about the fall of my little daughter and expressed His sympathy by uttering "Ch, ch, ch”.
I happened to say, "Baba this girl should have been born in the palace of some
king. She is so adamant even at this little age and dislikes any interference in her
actions. If somehow by love she is prevented from doing what she likes, her face
reddens and she faints." Making myself more explicit I related an incident when she
was moving towards a drain on her knees. The servant stopped her and took her on his
lap with great affection. At this she became so excited she turned red and fainted. The
doctor who saw her also could not help. Now they say that she will be all right
automatically when she grows up.
Baba listened to me and said, "They are fools. If this continues for some time
she will suffer permanent brain damaged and remain an idiot for the rest of her life".
I prayed to Baba, “If it were a boy he could some how be handled even after
becoming brain damaged, but for a girl it will be unmanageable for us”.
Baba said, "Don't worry, give her vyapak shaoca (a hip-bath) regularly. In three
days she will be temporarily cured and in thirty days she will be permanently cured”.
Baba was extremely kind and also explained the method of vyapak shaoca.
Then He enquired whether any of my children had previously died. I said “No” and He
replied “All right”. I returned home happy.
We needed a small tub for the kind of bath that was prescribed. I was in search
for one so that she could conveniently be bathed for thirty days, but unfortunately no
such thing was available in the local market. In this search one month passed. One day
my wife and myself were talking that one month had passed and we had not been able
to arrange the tub to give Mainju her baths as per Baba's instructions. I again showed
my helplessness about getting a tub and did not know what to do. By Baba's gracefrom the day her ailment was mentioned to Baba, she had had no fainting. I told my
wife, that Mainju has been alright from the time her trouble was mentioned before
Baba. Our duty only is to take things to Baba. He does the rest Himself.
In the meanwhile the arrival of my senior officer further delayed the acquisition
of the tub and the bath for the baby. Next day I went to the station to see off my officer.
The train was late, therefore by the time I returned from the station. It was nearly noon.
I therefore decided to go home, have lunch and return to office. So I came straight
home from the station. As I approached my house I saw that many of my junior officers
were standing on the balcony of my house. I was wondering why they were there. They
saw me approaching from the lane. One of them rushed to me and informed me that
Mainju was dead.
I scolded him for this and remembered that Baba had said only a few days back
that I was not destined to suffer the loss of any of my children. How could this then
happen? Thinking on these lines and remembering Baba, I rushed towards my house.
Everyone including the doctor was in the sitting room. As soon as I stepped into the
sitting room I enquired where was Mainju. The doctor and the assembled people
pointed to the dining table, where Mainju was lying with her face covered, as she had
been declared dead by the doctors. I reached the table and to everyones surprise,
Mainju uncovered her face herself and leaped towards me calling me “Baba” in
Bengali.
Remembering Baba all the time I took her in my lap. She was about one at that
time. The doctors were totally amazed. They immediately jotted down a prescription
and sent one of my office men to purchase the medicines. Meanwhile, my domestic
assistant informed me that my wife was lying unconscious in another room, from the
shock. I took Mainju in my lap and went near my wife and brought her to senses by
sprinkling some water on her face. As soon as she revived she lifted Mainju up in her
arms.
I bade farewell to the doctors after paying their fees. Everyone present there
was happily surprised by seeing that a child declared dead by two doctors was up and
healthy again and all began to praise the grace of Baba. I was feeling extremely happy
remembering the death destroying Grace of Baba in my mind. I was numb with
overpowering feelings of devotion for Baba.
I thought, "How kind Baba is. He removes the troubles of his devotees, before
they strike them”. I had no words to express Baba's grace. I surrendered myself
completely in words, thoughts and deeds to Baba and prayed that I might sing His
praise all my life. I hope Baba will grant me this.
After the commotion had setteld, we had out lunch. I told my wife that Baba has
only given a warning to us, but if we don't apply the treatment shown by Him, there
would certainly be a chance for calamity in future. While thus talking we saw the maid
taking the cleaned utensils inside the house. Amongst them was one utensil of brass
which had no handle and was like a tub. I suggested that Mainju could sit in this and be
bathed. If the edge will pain her outstretched legs we will put a towel on the edge to
protect her. My wife agreed with my suggestion. From that day on we bathed Mainju as
per Baba's instructions, in that utensil. We did not use the doctor's medicines. By
Baba's Grace Mainju never got that kind of fit against after this.
After this incident, my wife also insisted on being initiated. How can I bring
within the fold of language the description of his compassion? Hie whose description
the Vedas failed to achieve and finally came to the statements of 'Not this, not this!’ I
can only silently say that Baba is extremely compassionate and He showers Hisblessings equally on His disciples as well as those who are not. He is ever ready to
take them under His shelter.
When I visited Baba's place next, I requested for my wife's initiation and Baba
was kind enough to agree. When I was walking with Baba I asked that this sadhana is
so good, why should it be given on the basis of pick and choose. Kindly make it
available to all.
MY WIFE TAKES INITIATION FROM BABA
Baba said, ”Diiksa (initiation) and sadhana are given only after seeing the
samskaras (karma) of the individual, but as you are insistent, let me know the names
and addresses of those who are the seekers of Eternal Knowledge. I shall permit them
on the basis of samskaras”.
Really, after seeing the change in me which came after the initiation, a large
number of people were thinking of taking initiation. Some of them were officers in my
department and some were mere acquaintances.
When I was asking for permission to go and asked whether I could bring my
wife for initiation next Sunday, Baba said, "Yes you may, but do not bring any small
child with her."
I said, ”My youngest child could not be left at home”.
Baba replied, "The kundalinii of children below five is in a fluid state and it gets
aggravated by my contact and causes them pain”.
Therefore, when we came next time the young girl was with us but we tried to
lull her to sleep before going to Baba and by Baba's Grace she did go to sleep. After
this, we handed her over to Bindeshwariji and I took my wife to Baba for initiation. Only
when we returned after my wife's initiation did my daughter wake up. It was His Grace
that until we returned she remained asleep. This was the same girl who was declared
dead some days ago by the doctors.
This time I also brought a list of those who were desirous of taking initiation and
I submitted that list to Baba. Baba thought for a moment and allowed some of them and
some names of the list were not allowed. Along with this for each person the date and
time of initiation was also fixed. I informed the people about the date and time and gave
their addresses to Bindeshwariji, who took them to Baba's lotus feet at the appointed
time. I had already requested Bindeshwariji to take these persons to Baba and he
agreed readily.
This process of submitting lists continued up to December 1954. Personal
contact was the only medium for spreading the mission and Baba’s ideals. Any
reference to guru was forbidden.
Baba said, “The motivation inculcated by reference to the guru will not be
permanent. Guru will not live forever, and when the physical form will be no more, your
efforts will come to a halt. Therefore, always propagate the ideal".
Following His instructions we were always talking about the ideals and
spreading it through personal contact. Up to that time Ananda Marga had not come into
existence - nor was there any book containing a philosophy or code of conduct.
Whatever we heard from Baba was our philosophy and code of conduct, and we were
taking only its help for our propagation of the philosophy and practice Baba had given.
