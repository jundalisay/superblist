25th MARCH 1955

On the evening of the 25 of March, we started for a walk as usual, but midway
Baba turned and came back to the ashram. 

That day several senior disciple brothers
were present in the ashram and they took Baba into His room where He took His seat.
Baba then began to call these senior disciples one by one until they were all
assembled in the room and the doors were closed. Some of those in the room were
already acaryas and others were undergoing acarya-training. Shri Pranayji however,
was not there. Outside on the veranda were the more junior disciples, like myself.
When I observed that Baba had still not come out after a long time, I thought
hat He had perhaps started taking class. Taking a class could mean that Baba would
be occupied for up to two-and-a-half hours and so I concluded He would not resume
His walk that evening. I therefore decided to leave and Bindeshwariji and I left the
ashram for home.
We must have walked only about fifty yards when someone called my name.
We stopped and when that gentleman caught us up I recognized that he was a brotherdisciple. He told me that Baba was calling me and so I returned to the ashram along
with Bindeshwariji.
Baba was still talking to the senior disciples in the room and so I continued to
wait on the veranda. After a long tie, a senior disciple came of of the room and the door
opened, but he went back inside almost immediately pulling the door to, behind him. As
the door was a little ajar, some of the sounds from within drifted out to me. Then I
heard Baba chanting, "Hari, Hari."

Alarmed and with trepidition, I could not help peeping inside the room. I saw
that Baba was lying on a blanket spread on the floor, chanting "Hari, Hari," surrounded
by the other disciples watching Him.

Now full of anxiety, fear overcame my sense of propriety and I entered the room
without permission.

Pushing past several of the senior disciples I rushed into the room and spoke
directly to Baba, “It was only three days ago that You took a long samkalpa to live and
now You are again doing the same thing. I beg You, please stop repeating this
mantra!”
But Baba kept on repeating "Hari, Hari".
None of the disciple brothers there had been present on March 22nd and so did
not understand what I was talking about and stared at me in puzzled disapproval.
“Quick brothers” I said, “everyone must take hold of Him. Start pressing Baba's
feet and body and until He takes a samkalpa again, do not to leave Him.”
Exhorting them thus, I fell at Baba’s feet and began to massage them and
asked the others to do the same whilst explaining briefly what had occurred on the 22nd
arch.
Now their bewilderment fell away and shocked comprehension showed on their
faces, just as it had come to me on the preceding occasion. They saaw that we had to
intervene before Baba gave up His body. We were now all weeping and pleading to
Baba to give up the idea of leaving His body. But Baba continued chanting, "Hari, Hari."
Among the nine or ten disciples in the roo that day were respected Shri
Chandranathji (my medium), my childhood friend and classmates Shri Vishvanathji and
Bindeshwariji. I distinctly also remember the presence of Shivshankar Bannerjee,
Shishir Dutta, Shivanath Bose and Harisadhanji.
Except for Bindeshwariji, each one of us was massaging some part of Baba's
body. Bindeshwariji overwhelmed by emotion, was sitting in one corner breathing loud
and long. Every one of us was in tears and praying to Baba not to give up His body.
Totally desperate, I said to Baba, "Baba, this is cheating us. You told us that
You had taken a samkalpa to remain for a long time and it was only for three days! Do
not leave us in this sad and helpless condition."
Suddenly, Baba said, "Kishanji, your work is done".
Baba was addressing Kishanji, a disciple who was not there that day. I felt that
if Baba is talking in an incoherent manner to absent people, then the end must be near.
This thought fuelled my anxiety further and weeping all the more I cried out, "Baba,
what are you saying? Kishanji is not here!"Baba only responded with "Hari, Hari."
I was so confused and desperate at this juncture, that I asked one of the
disciple brothers who was sitting pressing Baba’s temples, "Cover Baba’s mouth with
your hands and stop Him chanting ‘Hari, Hari’.” Later I was horrified with myself that I
could have suggested such a thing, but then I was in a state of shock.
Then Baba addressed Vishvanathji, who was near His head, "What do you
desire?”

He replied, "May you be forever in front of me, Baba!”

Baba said, “Tathastu! May it be as you wish!”, then continued chanting "Hari,
Hari".

More than three decades later Acarya Vishvanathji could still, whenever and
wherever he desired, see Baba and converse with Him. This is the miracle of the
infinite grace and blessings of Baba. I feel honoured that for this unique blessing, Baba
selected my boyhood friend Shri Vishvanathji.

But now, in the roo with Baba, we lost all courage and were all weeping bitterly
still clutching hold of Him.

Then Baba seemed moved by compassion by our pitiable condition and said,
"All right, get me seated, I shall take a samkalpa again."
We all cried out in relief and we supported and lifted Him up as Hesat in the
lotus posture. Then He asked us to leave the room.
I protested, "Baba, three nights ago, you allowed us to remain in the room with
You. Why are You asking us to leave the room today?"
Baba said, “Nagina' it will be proper that all of you go out."
Thereafter, on Baba's instructions and assurance, we all want out and closed
the door. We all come to the inner veranda and began anxiously to wait for Baba to call
us back in the room. For sometime we waited patiently but as time passed, we began
to worry. I told a senior disciple brother that delay could be dangerous and so he
should seek Baba’s permission so that we may enter the room.
He called from outside, “Baba - may we come in?”

Baba said in a very solemn and clear voice, “Do not disturb me. I am taking a
long samkalpa”.

From the very sound of His voice, we could understand that Baba was now
perfectly healthy and we settled down to wait more easy in our minds,
After sometime Baba called us in. He was still sitting in padmasana and He held
His right foot with both His hands and said. “All is well, all is well.”
It was a mystery to me what Baba was doing and meant by this, and to whom
He was speaking. It remains a mystery to this day.
After sitting with us for some tie in the ashram, He left for His residence with
one of the senior disciple brothers. We followed Him for some distance and observedthat again His pace was very slow, until at about 10 p.m. we went our different ways
silently. We did not feel like talking to each other.
The next day I met some of my senior brother disciples and I asked them. "Why
is Baba doing this again and again?"
Pranayji said, "Baba has exhausted all His samskaras, and therefore He now
does not want to retain this body."
I said, "I have heard that the exhausting of all the samskaras is salvation, but I
have never before heard that the finishing of samskaras means death. Can you explain
this to me?
He explained, "After the samskaras are finished, this is certainly the state of
liberation, but for the welfare of the people of this world, liberated beings take a
samkalpa, or a determination, to remain in the world. This samkalpa becomes the new
samskara which enables them to retain this body for the service and well being of the
world. Unless such a samkalpa is taken there will be no reason to retain the body, and
death is a certainty. Therefore on March 22nd Baba took a samkalpa but it was for three
days only. That shows that until yesterday Baba was undecided whether to keep His
body or not. Even now we cannot say for how many days more Baba has taken this
new samkalpa.”

Although He had said that He was taking a long samkalpa my mind was already
apprehensive at the thought of the previous day’s event. This explanation made me
even more worried. On March 22nd Baba had said that He was taking a long samkalpa
but it proved to be only of three days. This time also Baba said that He was taking a
long samkalpa, but on the basis of the previous experience it could not be said whether
this was indeed a long time by our reckoning. Everyone who learnt of this incident
became sad and anxious.

The next day I went as usual to Baba's residence and did my pranam and went
for a walk with Him. Several times it came to my mind to ask Baba about the length of
the samkalpa, but I had no courage to start a conversation on this topic. Baba was still
walking slowly this day, but He kept to His regular routine was as usual after this event
and continued to go for His regular evening walks.



One evening soon afterwards this incident of 25th March, as we sat on the
tiger’s grave, Baba said, “now my mind no longer feels at home on this planet”.
Not quite understanding this, I sat looking into His face awaiting some
explanation.

“There is no ‘nirman citta’ person on the planet any more”, He said, “so I no
longer enjoy myself here”.

Baba had become very serious, and I knew that He meant what He said about
not wishing to continue living on this planet. He still wanted to give up His body. It
saddened me that He kept coming back to that subject. But to maintain the
conversation, I said, “Baba, what is ‘nirman citta’ person?”
“After intense meditation, when sadhakas attain the final goal of sadhana –
absolute perfection – if they have also exhausted all their samskaras, they continue tolive on the planet with the same bodies, or they obtain new bodies in order to serve
creation. The samkalpa to serve creation for a fixed period of time becomes a new
samskara for them. They stay on the planet for that fixed time and then depart. Such
perfected beings are called ‘nirman citta’”.
“Baba do these perfected beings also need to do sadhana?”
“They do not need to do sadhana, but they do so for two reasons: to enjoy bliss,
and to impress upon their disciples that they must do sadhana under all
circumstances.”

I shivered in my heart again, lest Baba leave us too.

MARCH 28th 1955

On March 28th, as Baba and I were crossing the wide bridge over the railway
line on the way to the field.

Baba said, “Nagina, if I do not keep my body, get ‘Ananda Marga Elementary
Philosop[hy’ translated into Maithili by a native speaker of the language. Mithila badly
needs the philosophy and it is an appropriate place for Tantra sadhana. In the past,
Tantra sadhana used to be very popular there, but today the practitioners are widely
scattered. I desire that Mithila should regain its proper status in this regard”.
Baba said no more, but His words, ‘I I do not keep my body’, created heart-
breaking confusion in my mind. Again I wondered if His samkalpa of March 25th had
also been for a short time. The darkness of gloomy fears surrounded my mind. I felt like
asking Baba about it again, but the thought of His leaving the body was so painful that I
dared not reinforce it in His mind by bringing it up, so I decided to hold my tongue.
