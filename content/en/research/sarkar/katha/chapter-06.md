During the rainy season in 1954, I had to go to Bhagalpur to attend a
departmental conference. Many other officers of my own rank also attended. 

When the meeting was over at about five, my boss, Asthanaji asked us to stay for tea. Amongst
those present, one remarked that Nagina might not take tea as he is doing some
special kind of meditation these days and there is a lot of change in his food habits.
At these remarks, everyone started to look at me and began to ask questions
about my sadhana. Everyone had an objection as to why should sadhana have
anything to do with one's food habits. Everyone was fond of eating and therefore my
answers were not acceptable to them.
Amongst my colleagues, there was one pandit who was an idol worshipper and
given to karmakand (ritualistic worship). This panditji was a vegetarian, but he was
extremely fond of food, particularly sweet dishes. He used to treat all his subordinates
as his religious hosts and would relish with significant joy all kinds of rich sweet
preparations at their expense. We used to think that he followed the principle that 'food
at others' cost is a real rarity in this world and should be taken repeatedly and
abundantly'. Sometimes even while taking his food, he would go the latrine to lighten
himself. When the topic of sadhana was being discussed, he jumped into the
discussion in the ancient posture of a religious debate and began to sing the praises of
idol worship.
I told him that I was not well versed in the scriptures, but as far as common
sense prevailed I contradicted this theory by repeating arguments which I picked up
from Baba's conversations from time to time. As my approach was logical, all present
agreed with it in their heart of hearts; but in order to incite the pandit to further
discussion, they outwardly supported the pandit's statements. Panditji was also
garrulous mostly to please our boss, Shri Asthanaji. All realised this. Shri Asthanaji also
recognised this fact and therefore he told me that I was defeated and thus he pumped
up the pandit further. The pandit in his excitement began to criticize yoga sadhana. I
therefore thought of silencing him.
I said, ”Panditji, it is but natural that you do not like yoga sadhana as it would
mean you being compelled to follow yama and niyama (the ten principles of morality)”.
As the reply was sharp he kept quiet.
However, our boss wanted to appease the pandit, therefore he said that he
agreed with panditji that one must eat, drink and be merry in this world and also
remember God from time to time. He said that he disapproved of total dedication to
God.
Almost unwillingly I said, “Sir, after hearing our talk you are thinking in your
mind to seek an opportunity to ask me to take you to the person where I learnt my
sadhana, but just outwardly you are supporting the pandit's statement”.
Everyone laughed heartily at this remark of mine. All were about to leave now
and I also left after this remark. The next day everyone had to come back to the office.
I spent the night with Shri Chandranathji who was responsible for taking me to
Baba for initiation. The train next morning was to leave very early and I missed it. Afterbreakfast, I rang up Shjri Asthanaji and informed him about my missing the train and
the consequent inability to reach my office. I requested him either to sanction me a
day's leave or to give me some office work for the day, so that I may utilize my time. He
told me that it was very good that I could not go as he had some work with me, and
asked me to come to the office.
I reached Asthanaji’s office at about nine and found that he was waiting for me.
After the exchange of greetings, he asked me to be seated and enquired as to how
yesterday I could know what was in his mind. I could not catch the point and asked him
as to what he was the referring. He then told me that he began to take interest in my
arguments when I was discussing with panditji and in actual fact he wanted to ask me
where to learn yoga sadhana. I told him that I was no mind reader and I only said
spontaneously what came to my mind about him. That day he repeated again and
again that he was quite keen to learn yoga sadhana and he was ready to do everything
for this. I told him that I was unable to commit anything without Baba's prior permission.
He was ready for this.
Jamalpur was on my route to my office and therefore, I finished my office work
in the afternoon and came by the evening train to Jamalpur. In the evening I went to
Baba's residence for darshan. After Baba's darshan I accompanied Him on His walk.
On the way I put in my request regarding giving initiation to my boss.
Baba said, "His time has not yet arrived".
I kept quiet and informed my boss about it. After some days I again met this
officer and he again insisted for diiksa. I told him that when I meet Baba next I shall put
in another request on his behalf for initiation. I got an opportunity to meet Baba after
some days.
Baba smiled and asked, "Are you insisting again and again because he is your
boss?"
I replied, “it is not so. Whenever he meets me like one desirous of knowledge
he insists on my requesting You that he may get permission. If I do not convey his
feelings to You, my mind feels guilty. Hence, whenever he insists, I convey the same to
You”.
Again when I met my boss he persisted in his request. This time it came to his
mind that perhaps I was not putting his request forcefully before Baba. I guessed his
feelings, but thought it best to keep quiet.
Thereafter when I got an opportunity to meet Baba, I told Baba for his
entertainment, "Baba, I am feeling like Trishanku. When I go to my worldly boss, he
sends me here with his request and You escape by saying that his time has not yet
come. Thus, I am being sandwiched between the worldly and the spiritual boss".
Baba laughed heartily at this and said, "Are you keen that he should be initiated
as he is your boss?"
I said, "No Baba, his behaviour towards me is like that of relation." When I was
about to leave, I asked again, "Baba, what reply should I give him?"
Baba was extremely kind and smilingly said, "Give him my postal address and
let him find me out." I felt gratified and paid my respects.
As per Baba's instructions I informed my boss by letter about Baba's address.Some days after receiving my letter, Asthanaji came to Monghyr and called me there
for some work. Towards evening the work was finished, but I could not return and there
was no steamer service during the night. Seeing an opportunity, I came to Jamalpur for
Baba's darshan.
Next morning again there was a call from that office and when I presented
myself before him, he seemed ready to go out. When I asked, he told me that he was
going to Baba for initiation. He asked me also to accompany him.
I refused and said, “It would not be proper on my part as Baba had instructed
me just to give His postal address to you and you should find out his residence
yourself. For me to do anything beyond this would be a violation of His instructions,
which I am not prepared to do at any price. Baba is all knowing and all pervading.
Whatever we do is in full knowledge of Baba.”
I therefore, requested Asthanaji not to make me violate His instructions in
anyway.
At this, Asthanaji told me that he would drive the car himself. There would be
neither the driver nor the orderly with him. As there are so many cross roads in
Monghyr with which he was not familiar, he therefore wanted me to guide his way only
until he reached a point outside Monghyr and on the road to Jamalpur, then he would
reach the place himself. I agreed to do this much.
He then took the driving seat in his car and I sat beside him. I brought him on
the road to Jamalpur, through the crossings and requested him to stop so that I could
return. He pointed out that no rickshaw was available there and therefore, how would I
walk all the way back. He therefore, suggested that I should go a little further with him
until I get a vehicle to return.
I was guessing his intent and told him that, "You want me to go with you up to
Jamalpur; alright, but I will not assist you in anyway to Baba's residence. I am turning
deaf and dumb for you right from now onwards". I said this and then sat in the car with
my face to the back.
My boss laughed at this. When the car reached a crossing near Jamalpur
railway station, he looked at me, but I turned my face away. After some time, he
stopped, asked a gentleman who was walking on the road about the way to Kashavpur
and then moved ahead in his car in that direction. I was looking just opposite to the
direction in which Baba's residence was situated, so that he may not see the
expressions on my face and guess the location of Baba's residence.
As the car reached some twenty five to thirty yards ahead of Baba's residence,
he suddenly stopped the car and told himself in my hearing that it appeared that Baba's
residence was somewhere near and we had gone a little ahead. So saying, he got
down from the car and asking neighbours, reached Baba's residence.
When, he returned to the car, he told me that the gate of Baba's residence was
open and he found Baba seated on a chair. He was very happy after the initiation and
when he said that Nagina was in the car, Baba said, "He knows my time and he will
come only at that time." All the way he continued to ask so many things about Baba.
On returning to Monghyr, I got busy in government work and in the evening
reached Baba's residence for His darshan. I had His darshan, had an opportunity to do
my pranam and then accompanied Him on His walk.When Baba sat down on the grave in the field, I asked him, "Baba, about the
gentleman who got initiation this morning, when he was coming to You, he told me that
Baba's residence was near about when he reached a little ahead of Your house. He
then came to your house by enquiring about it from the neighbours. How did it come
into his mind that Your house was near about and he had gone somewhat ahead?”
Baba replied, "When I saw that you were sitting at his side looking in the
opposite direction as if you had nothing to do with him, I motivated him to stop the car
and come to me." Great is Baba's Grace!
ASTHANAJI RECEIVES BABA’S GRACE
Some two months later, Asthanaji came to Monghyr again and next day called
me from Begusarai. When I reached the place of his stay I discovered that he had
come along with his entire family but he had not come out of his room since morning. I
thought he might be busy with some personal or confidential work, but when I sent
word of my arrival, he called me to his room. I was most astounded to see what was
happening there. Asthanaji was lying on his bed and tears were flowing incessantly
from his eyes. When I enquired about this, he started weeping still more bitterly and
asked me to sit down by his side. His wife was also there. She told me that since the
morning after his bath he had been like that. He had not even combed his hair after
taking bath. And when I looked at him, I found that his hair was dishevelled. His wife
appeared worried and he had forbidden anyone from outside be told about his
condition.
Now, he asked his wife also to go out of the room for some time. When she had
left and we were alone, he told me his story. He said that after taking his bath he had
come out of the bathroom and approached the dressing table to do his hair. He stood
in front of the mirror, which was big enough to reflect his whole body, and saw that
Baba was standing in the mirror. He was standing in front of the mirror, and normally
the mirror should have reflected his own image, but instead, he saw Baba there and
was extremely surprised at it. He could not rely on his own eyes, and several times
rubbed his eyes to see clearly, but he found that Baba was still standing in the mirror.
At this, he felt such a pleasant sensation that he lost the consciousness of his body and
began to shed tears of joy incessantly.
Hearing him and looking at him, I myself began to feel a sensation of ecstasy
and began to wonder at the infinite liila of Baba. How compassionate He is to His
devotees. Wherever His devotees may be, Baba is always with them. When Asthanaji
took time to come out of the dressing room, his wife came in, and when she saw his
condition she was amazed. She questioned him, but got no reply. She therefore
became worried.
I enquired whether he was feeling any strain due to the constant weeping. He
informed me that along with the flow of tears he was feeling a sweet sensation in his
heart and was thus enjoying bliss. But his difficulty was how to show himself to people
outside in this condition. Saying this, he again began to weep profusely and his wife
came into the room when she heard his weeping. I told her not to worry at all and only
advised her to remain indoors to avoid any embarrassment.
To Asthanaji I said, “In the evening when I go for Baba's darshan I shall inform
Him about you”.
He objected to this and said, “Please do not tell to Baba about it; lest my bliss
will end”. He asked me to stay with him, and so that day I could not go for Baba's
darshan in the evening.I had to stay on in Monghyr and next day again presented myself at Asthanaji’s
place at about seven in the morning. When I met him I found that he was still not in a
normal state. I told him that it would be better if he accompanied me to Begusarai and
stayed there for a couple of days and returned here after he became normal. He
agreed with my suggestion, and it was decided that his family would go with me to
Begusarai. In the afternoon, we took a boat at such a time that we reached Begusarai
by evening in view of his condition. He stayed there for three days and when he had
become absolutely normal he returned to Bhagalpur.
I finish this story of Baba's liila here and after saluting Him humbly pray that He
may grant such ecstasy to every one of his devotees.
