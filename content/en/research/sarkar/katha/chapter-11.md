I met Shri Deep Narayanji for the first time when he was a colleague during my posting at Bhagalpur in 1953.

Soon after, he was transferred to Karhagola and Madhepura. These places were also within the jurisdiction of the Begusarai office, so I still used to meet him now and then. 

Deep Narayanji in those days was a healthy, handsome, strong and well-built person, tall and attractive. He was also of a poetic temperament. His mind and nature, like his physique, were also beautiful, and these attracted people to him very much.
Being from Mithila, his language and behaviour were both very sweet and his food was
also dominated by sweet rich preparations. 

He was a lover of poetry and music. This made up a wonderful combination in his multifaceted personality. He was fond of varied tasty, beautiful and rich food preparations, which he would take in abundant quantities.

Whilst eating, he liked to eat large quantities punctuated with frequent requests to take more and he also served food in the same benevolent manner. He liked to oblige the innermost desire of those he served to have more. I saw him attracted towards philosophy and sadhana and so I therefore encouraged him to take initiation.

When his desire for sadhana grew strong, I requested Baba to give him initiation. 

After getting Baba's permission, Deep Narayanji was fortunate to get initiation
in the latter half of 1954. After initiation his food habits became more sattvika (sentient)
and he began to take greater interest in milk and milk foods. Even during wintry nights
when it is extremely cold, he prefers to eat beaten rice with moonlight like white curd
rather than any other food. He eats in a pleasant and carefree manner. He wouldn’t
mind topping his curd and rice with some dozens of rasagullas. In fact this would give
him his heart content.
With continued practice of sadhana, Deep Narayanji’s interest in literature and
music became more and more subtle and deep. From the very beginning his nature
was a lovely mixture of hard work and deep devotion, and such combinations are rare.
As his mind was pure and he surrendered himself fully to sadhana, he very soon
became Baba's favourite and passed his examinations as tattvika and acarya.
When Deep Narayanji sings the songs of Vidyapati or slokas of Giita,
emotionally with deep devotion, he sways the minds of thousands of listeners, indeed,
transports them, into the world of ecstasy. He prefers sitting in groups of devotees and
enjoys talks about Baba and saints. At such times he is at his best, full of ecstasy and
bliss. On these occasions one can see him shedding tears of devotion and singing
devotional songs so that everyone flows in that mood.
Looking at him in these moments one is reminded of these famous lines of
Surdas: ‘nisi din barsat nain hamare’ (‘My eyes are ever wet with tears’). His
devotion to Baba and attachment to the spiritual ideal are really great. He has
sacrificed his entire life for these objectives. His strong resolve is to reach the stage of
salvation. He is one of the most loving devotees of Baba. Once Baba was heard to say,
"Deep Narayanji sleeps in samadhi."
Salutations to Baba Who Removes the Painful Reactions of
Previous BirthsHARISADHANJI
During those days in the early 1950’s, one of my disciple brothers in Jamalpur,
Shri Harisdhanji, was not only unemployed, but also completely poverty-stricken and
lived with his elder brother. Even though he was himself in want, yet he had a great
tendency to donate to the needy. When he saw someone in need, he would give away
whatever he had. He was a very kind person and one cold evening, when he went
somewhere with a shawl wrapped around his body, he saw a beggar who was
shivering in cold. He took pity on the beggar and gave him his shawl. As he himself had
only this one shawl, he began to freeze in the cold nights and mornings. But, he did not
mind at all.
When Harisadhanji’s elder brother would suggest some means of earning a
living, he would feel aggrieved and would fast for several days. He had no money to
buy food outside, yet he would remain contented and peaceful.
Seeing his circumstances I requested him that he should agree to have his
meals with me. But he would not agree. Perhaps this hurt his self-respect. After my
continual insistence, he agreed that if Baba permitted he would not mind. He was so
devoted to Baba that he would seek Baba’s permission on every thing.
That same evening I referred the matter to Baba and requested Him kindly to
agree that Harisadhanji might take his meals with me as long as I was there.
Baba said, “What has this to do with you?”
I replied, "Baba I am insisting because of his circumstances."
Baba did not like this and said somewhat loudly "Why should you worry about
this?"
I told Baba with great humility and insistence "He is my disciple brother. If I am
not to take care of him will a stranger care for him? It is but natural that I should worry
about him. I shall be extremely grateful if you kindly permit him to take his meals with
me."
Baba said: "You are on leave it will cause you hardship also.”
I said: "Baba I shall manage and it will be no bother for me." After that, Baba
gave his permission.
I was staying with Bindeshwariji and he was bearing all my expenses. Now, I
began to feel embarrassed as to how I should tell him that another disciple brother also
would share my meals regularly. While I was worrying about this, Harisadhanji arrived
and in front of Bindeshwariji I told him that Baba had permitted him to take his meals
with me.
Bindeshwariji felt happy hearing this and said it was a very good idea and it
should be done. Harisadhanji said that he would start taking his meals with me from the
next day. I immediately understood that he would seek confirmation from Baba and so I
agreed. From the next day, he started eating with me.
In the meantime, I had to go to Delhi, and when I returned from Delhi, I did not
find this brother disciple. When I asked the cook said that one day he had arrived
sometime before the meals were ready. The cook asked him to wait and became busy
in cooking the meals. He waited for sometime and thereafter left never to come backagain. The cook also informed me that when this disciple brother was a child, he was
working as a cook in their household and he used to love him and take care of him.
Even now he was addressing him as "Thou". I immediately felt that man was rather
sensitive and it might be that some word of the cook hurt him and therefore he stopped
taking his food here. I therefore searched him out and persuaded him with great
difficulty to again start taking his meals with me.
This continued for hardly fortnight or twenty days. After having discovered a
hard stalk in the vegetables he asked the cook whether there was onion in the food.
The cook laughingly said, "There is," and added: "Don't you know that no
onions are added in the vegetable here? For years I have served as cook in your
family. Have you ever noticed any onions in your vegetables?"
Then I asked the cook to keep quiet and somehow persuaded Harisadhanji to
take his lunch, but he did not turn up for his dinner that day. As I was late in returning
from Baba that day, I did not look for him. When I met him the next day, he told me that
when Baba was returning from His office he told Him about the onion incident and
Baba told him in angry mood: "Are you not ashamed, why do you take your food
there?" Now he was-not at all prepared to take his food with me under any
circumstances.
He once more began his old routine. He would take his food once and then he
would not take anything for many days. So one day I again asked Baba about him, but
this time also, Baba rebuked me. In spite of His rebuke I went on insisting that this time
I shall make arrangement for his food somewhere outside, but Baba was not ready to
listen to anything. Then I kept quiet.
But while returning from the field I again requested Baba that I may be allowed
to make arrangements for Harisadhanji’s food. Baba didn’t say anything. After some
time Baba agreed to my request with the proviso, "If you can arrange for his food
without much difficulty somewhere outside, you may do so."
The very next day I pleaded with Harisadhanji to name any place and I would
make arrangements for his food, there. I only wanted him to indicate the place of his
choice. I promised that I would make all arrangements and he would not have to bother
about anything. Somehow he was persuaded to agree and named a hotel that was
supplying vegetarian food. I sent one of my local friends to the place and made all the
necessary arrangements. This went well for some time until Baba ordered me to go
home and my return was delayed. During my prolonged absence this arrangement also
broke down. I did not talk to Baba about this matter again, but continued to think how
much this person was suffering due to lack of proper food arrangements.
One day Baba was explaining ‘reactive momenta’ or ‘samskara’, and said that
the force of samskaras creates a mentality which enables the consummation of these
unspent reactions. I was already thinking about y disciple brother Harisadhanji, now it
became quite clear that he was having this trouble because of his accumulated
unspent reactions. That is why all my efforts to ease his circumstances had come to
naught. Baba always encourages his disciples to tolerate and bravely exhaust the force
of the samskaras.
On my insistence on behalf of Harisadhanji Baba had been agreeing to my
efforts to assist him, but at the same time He was discouraging this tendency also. On
one side was the force of samskaras, and on the other side this discouragement by
Baba to relieve him from this troubles, would created a formidable situation.His liila is really wonderful! As long as the disciple has the capacity, Baba does
not take the samskaras. In all circumstances He makes one go through the process of
exhausting ones samskaras. He is greatly moved by the sight of suffering person
enduring the consequences of their samskara, but He does not relent in their going
through the necessary cleaning process.
This is a good place to mention how my child-hood friend, Vishvanathji,
suddenly agreed to be initiated.
VISHVANATHJI
We were educated together, studying in the same school and living in the same
hostel for five years. Since childhood he was fond of simplicity and purity and away
from modern fashions. From his very school days, he had a special interest in puja and
reading of holy books. This continued to grow steadily. His daily routine included
kiirtan, signing the praises of the Lord, reading the Ramayana and practicing
pranayama. I was at the other extreme - fond of modern things - and liked to tease
such a friend with what I considered such old-fashioned habits. Sometimes when he
would close his eyes and do pranayama, I would mischievously close the other nostril
through which he was breathing with my finger. I would run away when he opened his
eyes. Even so I never found him becoming angry. He had conquered anger right from
the days of his childhood. Although there was great difference in modes of living and
thinking I had great intimacy with him. Those days also his speciality was his simplicity
and pure sentient habits of life.
After we left school, we met rarely. By God's grace during our service period I
had the good fortune to be again with him in Mahua. As a doctor he was quite well to
do and rich, yet his life continued to be simple and pure. He was constantly in search of
the company of saints and sages and this was becoming an essential trait of his
personality.
We lost contact after Mahua, but some three years later in the rainy season of
1954, I met him all of a sudden at the Samastipur station. After preliminary courtesies, I
informed him that I had become vegetarian. At first he did not believe me, but when I
informed him that I had even given up onions and garlic, he immediately tried to touch
my feet in token of respect to me. But the one who has converted me from a sinner to a
pious man, he is worthy of all respect - and you should also take shelter at His feet.
He said, "He is great. He has converted you into a vegetarian."
Thereafter, I informed him that I had started practicing yoga and that requires a
vegetarian diet. He was very happy to hear this and began to insist that he should also
be taken to Baba. In informed him that it is not possible to do so without His prior
permission. At this, he gave me his address and requested me to inform him after I had
obtained Baba's permission. When after some days I went to Jamalpur to see Baba, I
mentioned Vishvanathji's request to Him.
Baba instructed me, "His time has not yet come."
Vishvanathji was enquiring from me almost every week and I was informing him
according to Baba's instructions. When Baba had turned down the request two or three
times, I asked Him how I should reply to Vishvanathji now.
Baba said, “There is no need to send any reply as yet; now when his next letter
arrives, write him that he has got permission and he should come and take initiation”.I was happy to hear this and began to wait for Vishvanathji's letter. Formerly I
was getting his letter of enquiry every week, but since Baba had told me to inform him
on receipt of his next letter I did not receive any letter from him. I finally received a
letter after about a month-and-a-half later and I wrote informing him that he had Baba's
permission. He received my letter at the end of November or the beginning of
December 1954, and met me at Begusarai. Then he explained that he had been sent
on deputation to Sonpur and was so busy he had not been able to write for a long time.
The next day we went to Jamalpur and Baba initiated him.
Perhaps the time for guru darshan for Vishvanathji had not arrived earlier and I
was insisting on his being initiated. Therefore, Baba gave me a formula that solved the
problem, and there was nothing further to say. Vishvanathji stopped writing letters and
resumed only when Baba's grace was directed towards him. Therefore in these matters
Baba's wish is supreme.

Vishvanathji got initiation at a time when all the sadhakas were doing individual
pracar. I therefore requested him that he should also in his spare time help in this
pracar work. But his reply was not encouraging.
He said, "The time I will waste in making others understand can better be spent
on my own, doing sadhana a little longer."
I told him that perhaps after some days of sadhana he would think differently.
"You will not be able to rest without pracar", I said.
And this very thing happened. To do pracar work his blanket and bag were ever
ready to travel anywhere at short notice. At the time of initiation he was posted at
Narkatiaganj in Champaran District. He did pracar work with great enthusiasm in the
whole of this district. After initiation he would go to Jamalpur at least twice a month
without fail, and every time some people would accompany him to take initiation.
The climax arrived when once he brought a sadhu with flowing matted hair and
a small loin-cloth for initiation. I was also in Jamalpur at that time, and I had not seen
Baba initiating a sannyasi or one in the garb of a sadhu.
I asked Vishvanathji, "From where have you caught hold of him!”
The sannyasi informed me that he wanted to take initiation but I expressed my
doubt whether Baba would initiate such a person. His reply was very simple, that he
was very keen on initiation and if necessary was prepared to give up his garb of a
sadhu. And this is what happened. He was initiated, not as a sadhu, but as a family
man and later on it was discovered that he was in fact a married person and lived in
this garb at his own residence in a separate cottage.
The way Vishvanathji did pracar in Champaran, Darbhanga and Purnea
Districts was incomparable. After becoming Acarya, he perhaps initiated the largest
number of people. This was my great fortune, that after a childhood spent together, I
became his disciple brother again in the school of Ananda Marga and we both became
acarya and tattvika together also.
