While I was in Jamalpur, it was matters pertaining to Baba that occupied my mind. But the affairs of the outside world intruded from time to time. I had not put the matter of the appeal for the reconsideration of my demotion I had made in Delhi in February, completely out of my thoughts. However, I felt that whenever any brother
disciple would mention the issue of my demotion to Baba that it appeared to make Him
very sad. I had therefore become alert and arranged that no one should mention
anything about this to Baba and requested all my friends not to allude to my problems
in front of Baba.

APRIL 1st 1955: MORNING

Then on April 1st 1955 I received the information from my brother disciple and
colleague Shri Harivansha Jha of Mithila, that the appeal against my demotion had
been turned down. Although I was myself very upset on receiving this news, I still
cautioned him not to mention this to Baba as he was on his way to have Baba’s
darshan.
Despite my caution, Shri Harivansha Jha did tell Baba that my appeal had been
rejected, and hearing this, Baba became very unhappy and said; "Now I do not want to
retain this body. Those rascals have unjustly harassed Nagina a lot".
At noon Shri Harivansha Jha came to me and told me, “Baba was very sorry to
hear about the rejection of your appeal. He no longer wants to keep his body”.
I was very upset and asked him, “Why, despite all my warnings, did you
mention this to Baba?”
He said, “Baba asked me whether I had seen you. When I told Him that I had
met you only a little while ago he, I mentioned the rejection of your appeal in this
connection.”
I was not satisfied with this reply, but the damage was done. Now I was worried
why Baba was again referring to His desire to leave His body. Perhaps this time also
He had not taken the samkalpa for a long time? I feared what may happen and began
to wonder whether Baba wanted us to face such a tragedy and suffer the pains of
separation from Him? I worried about it the whole day.
At about five in the evening I met a senior brother disciple and I voiced my fears
to him. He took my misgivings seriously but could offer no suggestions to allay our
fears. I told him that I was afraid of going alone to go to Baba alone to do my pranam in
the evening, and requested him to accompany me. At first, he was unwilling as his wife
was gravely ill and hanging between life and death. The doctor had also called him to
say that he would come in the evening to see his wife. I knew about these personal
difficulties of but still insisted that he must accompany me to Baba's residence this
evening. Seeing how worried and frightened I was, he succumbed to my persistent
requests and agreed to go with me, but said that he would return early from Baba's
residence.

APRIL 1st 1955 : EVENING AT BABA’S RESIDENCE

As Baba used to go out for a walk after seven p.m. in those days, it was
decided that he would come to my residence at quarter to seven, and we would go to
Baba's residence together. Just as we were about to leave another disciple arrived
from Monghy bringing the proof of the Hindi translation of the book ‘Ananda Marga
Elementary Philosophy’ to be corrected by Baba. Baba had already given him an
appointment, and it gave me some relief to think that it would be possible to engage
Baba, if just for a little time, in proof reading. All the three of us left together for Baba's
residence.
We arrived and I awaited the opening of the door with some anxiety, however
we did not have to wait for long before Baba opened the door himself. He saw the three
of us standing outside but called me in alone. On other days Baba used to sit on a
chair, I would offer my pranam and then we would start for the evening walk. But that
day it was different.
Baba went back inside and remained standing and asked me to close the door.
I followed his instructions. He continued standing whilst He told me in all seriousness
"Nagina, these rascals have harassed you a lot. Today I give you an opportunity. You
tell me the names of all those whom you want to be punished".
I thought, “Baba is always talking about the bliss and welfare of all. How can He
be talking of giving punishment to someone today? Is he not testing me?”
Meanwhile Baba again repeated, "Speak, speak out the names of those
rascals. Today, I must punish them all."
I said, "Baba, I have no names to mention."
Baba again repeated "Nagina - I am short of time. I am giving you this last
opportunity. You will have to mention the names of those whom you want to be
punished,”
I said, "Baba, I shall not mention any name. If punishment has to be given here
I am, punish me to the extent necessary,”
Baba said at this, "Do not talk of principle at this moment - remain in reality."
I said, "No Baba - I do not want anyone to be punished."
In order to change the topic I said, "Baba two more brother disciple are standing
outside. May I be permitted to call them in?”
But Baba did not give His permission.
Then I said, "Baba, one of them has brought the proof of the book 'Ananda
Marga'. Kindly have a look at it."
Baba dismissed my suggestion with a wave of His hand. He was still standing,
so now I requested that He may sit down so that I could do my pranam to him. To this
He agreed, sitting on the chair, adding that He had very little time. I did my sastaunga
pranam and Baba blessed me. After this, Baba remained seated, so I sat at His feet
and began to massage them.I had been apprehensive all afternoon, and when I heard Baba saying that He
was short of time and asking me the names of those who were to be punished, my
anxiety increased further. Hot alarm surged through me like flames blazing up from the
coals at a blast from the bellows.
Baba was sitting silently as I massed His feet in great perturbation of mind
when I began to feel that His feet were getting cold.
“Baba!” I exclaimed, “Your feet are getting cold!”
“Yes”, He said quietly, “now I shall not retain this body."
Deeply distressed I began to weep. On the previous occasions when Baba
wanted to give up His body, there were always one or more brother disciples with me
which gave us a sense of relief and mutual support. But this time I was all alone with
Baba and I was not feeling confident to bear this calamity without support. I began
weeping and pleading with Baba not to give up His body and at the same time was
massaging His feet as I did not know what else to do to stop Baba from giving up His
body.
I pleaded, "Baba! Do not go away leaving us helpless!”
Baba said wearily, "Nagina, you had a great ambition to be Assistant Collector. I
am making you Assistant Collector here and now. Now you give me up."
I remonstrated with Baba, “This would mean trading with your life which I shall
never do. At this price I want no treasure of the world, let alone the Assistant
Collectorship! Whatever may happen to me, You should remain in this world!" Saying
this I began to weep again.
Baba said again, "No Nagina! You should not do like this. Take the kingdom of
this world but leave me".
I had reached the depths of my feeling of impotence, but suddenly by Baba’s
grace, I found the strength to reassert my determination. I declared, “This would be a
losing proposition for me and I shall not going to leave You at any cost."
During this exchange, I had been holding His feet firmly and felt them now
becoming ice-cold. I was crying loudly and bitterly and now Baba began to push my
hand away to get His feet free.
Seeing no other course open to me, I twisted myself around His feet and began
to beseech, "Baba! Do not leave us orphans and helpless in this manner !”
Now I closed my ears to all Baba’s remonstrances and only repeated
insistently, "Baba some how or other you must remain amidst us. You have twice
assured us that you are taking a samkalpa to live a long time, but in fact, both the times
you deceived us." My condition was bizarre; I was weeping as well as speaking, but
Baba appeared unmoved.
In the meanwhile Baba suddenly said, "Nagina! All right, get up. Let us go to the
field."
I said, "No Baba as long as you do not promise I shall not leave You."
Again Baba said, "Look! Do not insist! Get up! We shall go to the field."I let go and heard Baba order Himself in a tone of command, "Prabhat Rainjan
Sarkar! Get well for sometime. You have to go up to the field."
Then Baba stood up suddenly and began to walk towards the door. When I
followed Him, I glanced into the back room and saw Baba's mother approaching the
room we were in. Now I understood why Baba suddenly got up in haste. She had
perhaps come from another part of the house after hearing my crying. Baba had
become aware of this although that room was not visible from where He was sitting.
By now Baba had left the room and I know began to regret having agreed to go
to the field. Had we remained there and had I told Baba’s mother everything, she would
also have given support to me and that would have been a powerful support indeed.
Outside, I saw my senior brother disciple and silently motioned to him to
accompany us to the field. He pointed out some difficulty, but I took him along with me.
This senior disciple brother was present in the ashram on 25th March 1955. On the way
we met two other brother disciples and I silently asked them also to come to the field
with us also.
That day Baba was walking in a strange manner. He appeared to be walking
mechanically as if only two legs were walking without any connection to the rest of the
body. Normally as one walks, the arms automatically swing to and fro, but, Baba was
walking and His arms were hanging from his shoulders immobile. He was breathing
heavily with rasping breath. His gait was unnatural and the sound was unpleasant to
hear.
We followed Baba silently. On the way, my thoughts revolved around one idea:
"What is that power that ordered ‘Shrii Prabhat Rainjan Sarkar get well for sometime,
you have to go up to the field.’ But I have not been able to find a solution to this riddle
till this day. It is an unsolved question, which Baba alone can solve. Whether that
moment will come in this life, I cannot tell.

APRIL 1st 1955 : EVENING
AT THE FIELD
Now we had reached the field and as we approached the tiger’s grave, we
found Shri Kishanji already there. Baba usually sat of the tiger’s grave facing north, but
that day He sat facing west.
I was relieved at Shri Kishunji’s presence for I felt that he would understand my
anxiety and give support throughout whatever crisis was to come. Soon, though, I saw
that he, like the others, was reacting with helpless passivity.
There were now five of us there, and by Baba's grace my determination had
returned. I told my brother disciples, "Today again, Baba is trying to make us
shelterless by leaving His body as He has attempted to do twice before. Let us
therefore catch hold of Baba's feet and plead with Him, and go on pleading with Him,
until He promises that he will not give up his body”.
All of us began to appeal to Baba that He should discard the thought of giving
up the body from His mind.
Baba said, "Nagina, this would be against the principles of Nature. It would be
wrong to do anything against the laws of nature."I told Baba, “The rules of nature are for those who are within the bondage of the
world, but You are the master of nature therefore nature will follow Your dictates.
Kindly, do not mislead us by taking recourse to the laws of nature. Do not leave us
helpless and shelterless. You should take pity on us! Why have You become so hard-
hearted and cruel?”
Baba then said, "Now let me see how you do your Iishvara pranidhana
(meditation) here?”
I said, "Baba do not deceive us in this manner. Today we are not going to do
anything which requires giving up the hold of Your lotus feet”.
Baba tried to entice us with many inducements of spiritual experiences we
could have in sadhana, but we were not prepared to give up the hold of His feet.
Then Baba told us straightforwardly and clearly, “Let me go. My time is over!”
We were already weeping and pleading with Baba, now we became all the
more desperate and began to weep and insist that Baba should not give us up in mid-
stream like this. But today Baba became absolutely hard hearted and looked as if he
was completely unaffected by our entreaties and requests.
He again said, "Leave me”, and began to pull His feet forcefully from our grasp.
It was a heart-rending experience. I was thinking how He who meditation had
always been so loving, whose lotus feet we were never tired of embracing and who had
been never unwilling for us to do so, had hardened His heart towards us today. He who
had listened caringly and was always so loving was today using force to remove our
hands from His lotus feet. Could this be the same kind Baba? It could not be conceived
that same Baba who was giving infinite love could become so cruel and hard-hearted.
When we envisaged the calamity ahead, we understood that Baba was not only an
ocean of love but was also harder than the hardest vajras (thunderbolt).
Evil days and misfortune loomed before us in a fierce form and we had no other
recourse but to beg for His mercy. It is my prayer that no sadhaka may ever face such
an evil day.
Thinking, "Oh God, what is in store for us? Has Baba forgotten the meaning of
compassion, pity and love?” I became all the more desperate and wept bitterly.
But all our weeping and entreaties were in vain. Baba did not melt. Once he
pushed so hard with His hands that all the five of us fell flat on the ground. While still
lying on the ground, I asked Shri Kishanji to grasp Baba's feet quickly, and everyone
quickly got up and caught Baba's feet again. There was no room for me to do this and
so I knelt behind with my arms around Baba’s waist laying my head on His shoulder so
that my cheek lay on His chest.
Still weeping, I was pleading with Baba not to be so hard-hearted.
But Baba was only saying, "Leave me! Leave me! Give me up."
Then once more Baba said, "Nagina, you take all the wealth and the powers of
the world, but give me up."I said, "Baba this will be very losing bargain for us. I consider everything in this
world as a useless trifle compared to Your life which is all in all for us. We shall be
eternally grateful if for our sake You kindly keep Your body. Thus alone the world will
be saved and in this lies the good of the world."
Baba said again, "Do you want that atom bombs and hydrogen bombs strike the
earth and I remain a silent spectator?”
I said deferentially, "Baba, it all depends upon You. If You desire, these bombs
will strike the earth, but if you do not so will, it cannot happen. All this is as you wish.
What has this to dowith You giving up the body?”
Instead of answering my question, Baba said, as if to reassure us, “After taking
my decision to leave the body, I created powerful spiritual vibrations with the help of my
varabhaya and janusparsha mudras. With the help of those vibrations, you people
should progress and guide the world to the Supreme Beatitude”.
I did not understand these mystical things then, so I disregarded them and
focussed my attention on keeping Baba’s body alive. But Baba, being anrayami or all-
knowing, explained without my asking.
“Nagina, I have already released the vibrations of the varabhaya and
janusparsha mudras. With the help of the psychic and spiritual energy accumulated
from your sadhana, you will be able to contact these vibrations. Just as you receive
guidance from me physically, you will also receive guidance from these vibrations”.
I said, “It is good that You have released those vibrations for us. But it would be
even better for us if You stay with us along with those vibrations. That way we will get
double benefits. SO please give up Your idea about leaving the body”.
I reasoned that we could get direct love and guidance from Baba as we knew
Him. To trust to a dark, unknown future, hoping that one day we would acquire the
spiritual energy with which to get in touch with those subtle vibrations, woule be
absolute folly. Besides, that long and difficult path would be impossible for a common
sadhaka like me. I recalled the Samskrta proverb, ‘hastastham pindamutsrjya
bhramante jeevitashaya’, (only the foolish go begging whilst ignoring the food in their
hand). So I could never imagine reconciling myself to Baba’s offer.
By this time I was becoming numb and exhausted from the continual weeping
and pleading. I was now so weak that I was unable to speak and continue this round of
circular arguments. I beseeched my brother disciples somehow to persuade Baba not
to give up his body.
But Baba remained adamant and deaf to our pleas, single-mindedly repeating,
“The time has come. I must go.”
Salutations to Baba who is the Giver of Everything Like
KALPATARU
Then Baba said "Nagina! You had a strong desire that I become the Kalpataru.
Lo! I have become the Kalpataru now! Ask whatever you desire".I thought this was another attempt by Baba to lull us into forgetfulness and I,
therefore said, as before, that I wanted nothing from the Kalpataru and I have nothing
to ask from the Kalpataru.
On hearing me, Baba very affectionately explained to me, “No, no Nagina! This
is not the way to speak before the Kalpataru”.
I had already made up my mind that I wanted nothing else except that Baba
may retain His body and in the same strain I repeated again that I had no request from
the Kalpataru.
Baba repeated very tendely,“No Nagina! This would almost amount to insulting
the Kalpataru”.
Now it dawned upon me that I should express my true heart's desire before the
Kalpataru, so I said, “If it is an insult not to ask anything from the Kalpataru, then my
request to the Kalpataru is that for fifty years from today every year we should
celebrate the Kalpataru day before your physical body”.
Hearing this, Baba shouted loudly, “You have tried to be clever. This cannot
happen. I give you one more opportunity. You must change your request”.
I was quite frightened of Baba's loud voice, but the next moment, itself through
Baba's grace, I regained my firmness and said, “It is heard that no one returns
disappointed from the Kalpataru. Today, I have to see whether my desire is fulfilled or
not”.
As I said this, Baba again in a loud and resounding tone, “Nagina ! Everyone
else can have blemishes, but the Kalpataru has ever been unstained and will ever
remain so. Even then, I give you one more opportunity. Change your request.”
I also, through the grace of Baba, said imploringly but with firmness, 'If the
Kalpataru is forever spotless then my request is also unchangeable, it is stable and
steady. Today it is to be seen whether Kalpataru satisfies my request or not.”
Now Baba’s tone became a little mild and He tried to persuade me, “Nagina!
One should not make a request that may be against the principles of nature and
contrary to the laws of creation. You must try to understand this and change your
demand and ask for something else”.
We continued this battle of wills, Baba insistent and I unyielding. But in spite of
Baba's repeatedly asking me to change my request, I remained steady in my desire
and continued to request that the Kalpataru may grant my desire.
Finally Baba said, “Nagina! Will you not agree?”
I replied , “No Baba! I shall never change my desire at any cost'”.
Now Baba grew kind and asked me to repeat my desire. I stated it formally
thus: “Before this physical body of yours, may we celebrate Kalpataru Day every year
for fifty years from today”.
Baba said, “Be it as you wish”, and patted me firmly on the head.Relieved I cried, “Jai Baba'” (“Victory to Baba”), and withdrew my hands from
around Baba’s waist. I lifted my head from His chest, and cried again and again, “Jai
Baba! Jai Baba!” and folded my hands in reverence.
I asked the other brother disciples to let go of Baba's feet and helped Baba sit in
the lotus position so that he could take a samkalpa very soon. When, I was doing this,
Baba gave a loving slap on my left cheek and said, “You have come to know all my
secrets”.
BABA TAKES HIS FINAL SAMKALPA
Whilst Baba started taking His samkalpa sitting in padmasana (lotus posture),
we remained seated at His feet. Now, we were all feeling as if life was coming back to
us.
After taking His samkalpa Baba sat silently and we began to massage His body
and feet.
Baba said, ”Nagina, I had taken out seven-eighths of the pranah from my body,
the body is therefore somewhat weak”.
After about twenty or twenty-five minutes more, Baba said, “Nagina if you
cannot bring me water very soon, it will be difficult to retain this body despite the
samkalpa”.
Now, we were worried as to from where we could get water in this desolate
place. My eyes fell on a light in a railway officer's quarter which was about a furlong or
two away. I asked Harivansha Jha who was one of the younger brother disciples there
and an officer in my department, to rush to the lighted house and fetch water from
there.
Harivansha Jha somehow ran in the dark and reached the house. As he
climbed the stairs to the veranda,a largeGerman Shepherd dog jumped at him. He
thought quickly and crouched down and the dog jumped over him. By that time, the
owner of the house came out and he controlled the dog.
By now my Harivansha Jha was panting heavily for two reasons, one as he had
run all the way and second because of the dog. Before the owner could ask a single
question, he blurted out, "Give me some water!"
The owner went in and came out with some water in a silver tumbler. Shri Jhaji
took it and without speaking a word to the owner, ran from the house. The owner was
struck dumb with surprise.
In this interval, Baba had asked for water several times. His throat and mouth
was dry with thirst and when He tried to speak, only a “chat chat” sound emerged His
throat.
The longer we waited for water, the more restless Bab became, and we were
also feeling very desperate. Feeling that perhaps the first person had not been able to
obtain water, I asked another Shri Harisadhanji, also one of the younger brother
disciples, to run to the road that leads to the church. I told him, At the crossroads there
is sweet shop and I have seen a container of water there. Bring water from there". He
too now ran on this desperate errand in search of water.
Baba again asked for water.I, said "Baba those who have gone to fetch water have not yet returned, I have
heard that thirst can be controlled through mantra also, kindly use that device for the
time being."
Baba said, "I have already applied that device and it is not possible to do it any
further. If someone else applies the mantra, it will be more effective."
I said, “Baba, we do not know the mantra and its use. You have not taught this
to us. What is to be done?”
Baba said, "I shall give you the mantra right now. Repeat it just now and apply it
on me" The mantra is “Vambhasi tattvam idam tistha”.
I no longer recall the number of times that Baba asked me to repeat it, but I
completed the japa as He directed and told Baba when it has been completed.
Then Baba said, "Touch my vishuddha cakra with your little finger and keeping
the finger there repeat this mantra thrice". I did as directed.
Baba was now somewhat steady and said, "Nagina you can keep me without
water with the help of this for half an hour. After half an hour the effect of this mantra
will be over. By thenyou must arrange for water. You can use this mantra at the most
up to three times."
Baba seemed a little recovered and we also relaxed a little.
While sitting at His feet, I podered, “By whose imagination alone, unnumbered
creations came into being and by whose idea this whole universe is sustained and
whose slight turn of mood can annhilate this whole universe, that Almighty is today
desiring some water to quench His thirst!” I was bemused by this thought and said to
myself, “O Lord Great is your play (Liila)".
Again I began to think of Shri Jitendra Jha who had gone to fetch water and
was anxiously looking in the direction in which he had run to fetch water. I was eagerly
awaiting the water when I heard the sound of running footsteps and soon he
approached us. He was panting heavily and whilst running the half the water had
spilled from the tumbler. Anyway, I gave what remained to Baba, and after drinking it
Baba became more normal.
After some time, Harisadhanji returned bringing a big glass of water. I gave that
water to Baba also, and after this He seemed completely restored.
By now, it was about ten or half past ten in the night, but Baba was still sitting
on the grave. After sometime again, we gave water to Baba to drink and requested Him
to return.
Because I was insistent on Baba’s returning, Baba explained that he had taken
out about seven-eigthh’s of His pranah outside His body His joints were not yet revived
and He was as yet unable to stand or walk.
I said, "Baba give some time, I shall run to bring the car here and take you to
your house in convenience.
Baba said 'Nagina." Walking is the remedy for this condition. The other
alternative is to go into nirvikalpa samadhi. But, I do not want to go into nirvikalpa asthere will be no desire to return to the body again and I have already taken a samkalpa
for retaining the body. Therefore, walking is now the only alternative. As I had removed
a major portion of the pranah from the body, to establish perfect adjustment between
mind, pranah and body will now take about one month's time.”
I humbly suggested that through the use of mantra also, pranah could be
circulated through the joints.
Baba said,”Yes, but it would be better to wait and see for some time more.”
For sometime Baba sat silently and we continued to massage Him.
Baba then put His right foot on the ground and told us, “You all touch the toe of
my foot.”
We did as directed and Baba blessed us most mercifully. That day, He blessed
us in a most wonderful and strange manner and the blessing itself was quite long.
Baba’s blessing was in Samskrta, so I do not remember it fully. I only recollect the last
portion, “Be blessed with the greatest glory”.
After blessing us Baba again sat silently, I waited for some more time, but when
it was getting late, I requested again that for bringing pranah to the joints let there be
the use of mantra.
Baba said, ”Yes, now I shall have to apply the power of mantra.”
Then Baba very kindly applied mantra on every joint of His body whilst we all
sat and watched.
After applying the mantra in this way, Baba slowly stood up and began to walk
extremely slowly. We also began to walk on both sides and behind.
Meanwhile I told my brother disciples to return the tumblers and to then meet us
on the way. As we approached Baba's house, He gave us leave and wanted to walk on
alone, but on our insistence, He permitted one disciple, Shri Harisadhanji, to
accompany Him up to His residence.
I was waiting for Harisadhanji at Bindeshwariji’s, where I was staying and he
came and informed me that Baba that Baba had got home safely , though in a weak
condition.
There are many myths and stories prevalent about this incident of Baba
desiring to give up His body. I hope that these lines will remove all false impressions
and present the true picture before the readers.
THE AFTERMATH
When I went to bed that night, I could not fall asleep the events of the evening
began to come in my mind one after the other. I recalled that at one point, in an attempt
to loosen our hold on His feet, Baba had sent all five of us flat on the ground in one
stroke and our grasp had been broken. At that time, Shri Kishanji was about forty, very
strong and built like a wrstler. The rest of us were younger and all strong and well built.
Baba had had only one-eighth of the pranah remaining in His body then, and yet He
was still so powerful that He knocked all five of us flat with one push. This gave me
some indication of His physical strength and I realised that His powers were not onlyspiritual, but physical also. With thoughts like these running through my mind, I finally
fell asleep.
The next day the news of this event spread amongst all the disciples. When
Bindeshwariji came to know about it, he enquired about the three times when Baba had
desired to give up his body and then appeared to concentrate deeply for some
time.After some time he laughed in great delight telling us, “All this is the play of
Giridhar Gopala (Krsna)”, meaning Baba. He told us that on each of these occasions,
he had also the feeling that his own body would not last and the thought of death had
been strong in his mind. When Baba had given Bindeshwariji the gift of new life after
the February DMC in Bhagalpur, Baba had said that He had given a portion of His own
pranah and mind to him. It was, therefore, but natural that where the source from which
he got his life was itself drying up, his condition would be the same.
As on all these three occasions Baba kept me vocal and determined, all the
disciple brothers were happy with me.
Shri Pranayji who had been with me at the time of the first incident on the 22nd
March 1955 was also very happy, but he said, "You have asked for the boon for a very
long time, will not Baba have difficulty in retaining the body for such a long time?”
I said, "Dear brother, nothing had been premeditated or prepared in advance.
The situation was such that there was no time for thought or preparation. I mentioned
fifty years on the spur of the moment, but this must also have happened according to
Baba’s wish. All that I wanted was that Baba should continue to live. Whatever has
happened, I am happy that Baba will retain His body for a long time now.”
Baba was looking weak during His walk that evening, and was walking very
slowly. When I enquired about His health, He said, "It will take some time before
complete adjustment takes place between the body and the pranah.”
As on every other day, Baba walked up to the field, took some rest on the grave
and then returned.
After two days, I met the manager of the ashram and I talked with him about
Baba's health. He also agreed with me that Baba had become very weak and we
should so plan that He may regain His full health as soon as possible. I insisted that if
He permits, I shall arrange the supply of fruits that I may regularly send to Baba's
residence. He permitted me. I then, enquired that if permitted I may take milk and fruit
juice to Baba's office at lunchtime. He agreed on this also. Next day, I went to Monghyr
and whatever juicy and other good fruits I could get, I brought them in a basket. As I
returned, I was informed that the manager was searching for me.
Meanwhile, a senior brother disciple came to me and he called me aside and
told me that I should not take fruits to Baba's residence. He also said that when the
manager talked about your fruit to Baba, while they were in office, Baba was very
angry. If you take the fruit Baba will be very much annoyed.
I listened silently for some time, but: I did not agree with this. I said "Dear
brother, I have brought these fruits for Baba alone and I would certainly like to take
them to Him. It is up to Him to accept them or not. I shall not return them to the shop. It
will be very kind of you if you also accompany me."
But my brother disciple was not at all ready to accompany me. He was quite
scared. Looking at him, I also felt worried for some time, but then it came to my mind
that how others can make use of something which has come for Baba. I, therefore,strengthened my resolve and in the evening before Baba left for His walk, I was there
at His residence with the basket of fruits. I left the basket in the car and instructed the
driver that when I call you, you should bring this basket up to the door of Baba's house
and hand it over to me.
After waiting for some time Baba Himself opened the door. But unlike other
days he did not sit on the chair, but said instead, "Let us go for a walk".
I said, "Let me do my pranam, Baba, kindly sit down".
Baba said, "Let us go, you can do the pranam in the field".
I insisted on doing the pranam there and requested Baba to sit down for some
time. Baba sat down and I did my pranam and Baba blessed me as usual and then I
hurried to the door and standing at the door called the driver. He was already prepared
and very soon he brought the basket and handed it over to me. I brought it in and
asked Baba as to where should I place it?
Baba said in an angry tone, "Why have you brought it here?"
I said, "Baba now I have brought it. Kindly let me know where to place it?
As the basket was heavy it began to slip from my hands and again I asked as to
where I could put it. The basket again began to slip from my hands.
Baba then smilingly said "Put it on the bench in the side room."
I placed it as directed. Then Baba said, "Why did you bring these fruits without
my permission?"
I confessed to my mistake. Baba then did not say anything. I asked Baba,
Would you like to sit in the car which was standing outside".
He said "By using the car, no walk will be possible and walking is a medicine for
me these days."
I asked the driver to take back the car and I accompanied Baba on His walk.
That very week, on a particular day, Baba was to go to the house of a senior
disciple brother. It was my responsibility to take Baba there. When Baba was returning
from his house, I asked, “Can Kalpataru could also give physical things?”
Baba said, "Yes”, but he explained further why this was not desirable.
Even years after this incident of 1st April 1955, Baba used to say, "Nagina's
victory and my defeat have given you Ananda Marga.” He has said this so often that
people came to hear of it and on this account my name became well-known, although
my face was familiar to but a few. I was often sought out and asked about the event,
and those who got hold of me wanted to hear every single detail. After more than thirty
years, the number of enquiries seems only to have increased, not dimished.
This fame was nothing that I desired, however, and it does not gratify me.
Indtead it frightens me. In fact I go out of my way to avoid meeting new people, for fear
that they may ask me about that occasion.Once there was a DMC at a dharmashala in Monghyr. A stage had been
prepared for Baba in the courtyard. But the crowd overflowed and some sat on the roof
of the building, myself amongst them. A huge peepal tree grew in that courtyard, its
branches overhanging the roof where we sat. At the end of His discourse, Baba said,
“Nagina won and I lost, and this has given you Ananda Marga”.
Baba's grace is indescribable. Everything He does Himself and gives credit to
me. The largeness of His heart and his generosity is beyond all limit and feelings.
Taking shelter of this grace, I pray that He may always keep me - one who is
engrossed in the illusions and attractions of this world - and who is nothing in himself -
under his shelter. I am bound to commit sins and faults as I am engrossed in illusions
and in a man's body -even so it is my strong desire that I may always take shelter in
His lotus feet. I am waiting for that great day.
Prior to writing about this incident, and for that matter writing anything about
Baba, I have striven to surrender myself at His feet, in case even the slightest amount
of ego might be present in the remotest corner of my mind. Only He can protect me
from that great destruction. I pray iin humility that I may never forget His liila.
