During December 1954, some disciples wanted to establish an organisation to speed up the spread of Baba’s ideals and they requested Him to give them permission in this regard.

Baba made some enquiries and kindly consented.

In order to prepare the constitution of this Samgha, some disciples gathered on the 25 December 1954. Fortunately I also went to Jamalpur that day and when I was going to Baba in the morning, they, together with Baba, met me on the way. I touched

Baba's feet in pranam and found Baba in a very pleasant mood.

Baba said, "Today some people are going to write the constitution of the Samgha. You should go and help them and come to meet me at four in the afternoon". 

Baba left after telling me this. Shri Deep Narayanji and Dr. Vishvanathji were with me. Shri Vishvanathji had been my classmate since childhood and had taken initiation on my request recently. We thought the matter over and decided to go for
writing the constitution after taking our meal, as the writing of the constitution was going
to take time. Thus we returned to Bindeshwariji's house and began to prepare to go
after taking our lunch.


## I INCUR BABA’S WRATH

In the meanwhile two other brother disciples came to Bindeshwariji. They also
had the same task in mind. I was a big smoker then, but despite this I decided not to
take my cigarette case with me. Earlier also I had never taken my cigarette tin with me
to Baba's place. As in Jamalpur I always stayed with Bindeshwariji, I always left my
cigarette case there. I wanted to do the same this time also. I was following this
practice just to observe good manners. I never had the inclination to give it up
altogether. Cigarette smoking was a great weakness with me.
Both my brother disciples said that I would be required there to write for a long
time and so I should take my cigarettes with me. Even then I did not agree, but
Vishvanathji took the box in his hands offered to take it himself. So they started and we
followed them. I did not thin that it was good that someone else was carrying my
cigarette tin for me, so I took it from him. Thus we reached that quarter of the railway
colony where we were to write the constitution. I left my cigarettes outside on a window
ledge and entered the room. My brother disciple suggested that I should bring my
cigarettes inside with me, but I disagreed and left them outside.
In the room we spread a blanket on the floor and started deliberating on the
constitution. On one side there was a small wooden bed with cushions on it. On that
bed there was a photograph of Baba in varabhaya mudra, in a beautiful frame. Shri
Pranay Kumar Chatterjee used to stay in this house and we were under the impression
that this was his quarter. Baba had given demonstrations in the back room of this very
same house during the previous month of November 1954. After some discussion the
composition began and everyone asked me to write. I started doing so under their
dictation.
The writing continued for a long time. At about three in the afternoon I sought
permission to go out for five minutes for a stretch. They sensed my need and asked
whether I was going out for a smoke. I replied in the affirmative. At this they suggested
that I could smoke in the room itself. I objected to this as it would be quite impolite andinconsiderate but as I was going out I was stopped and someone rose and brought my
cigarette tin from outside.
As I was about to light my cigarette, Shri Pranayji who stayed in that house,
took away Baba's photograph to another room and placed an earthen ashtray for me.
When he was taking away Baba's photograph I again said, “what are you
doing? I shall go out myself. Kindly keep the photo here."
Even then he did not agree and took the photograph away into another room. I
felt very pained at this. Unwillingly I lit the cigarette and after one or two puffs it went
out. I tried to light it again, but meanwhile the last match burned itself out without
lighting the cigarette.
We tried to write further, but the atmosphere had changed and we could not do
so. Our minds were disturbed. At about three-thirty we stopped work as I had to reach
Baba's place at four o'clock.
Shri Deep Narayanji and myself started towards Baba's place. When we
reached there, we found Baba very angry. Just looking at His face we understood that
this was His 'rudra rupa'. I had never seen Baba in this mood before. Both of us
therefore were frightened. In this state of fear we tried to do pranam, but Baba said in
an angry tone, "Get away".
I was completely abashed, but Deep Narayanji fell at His feet. After seeing this I
also took courage and did my sastaunga pranam.
Baba said in the same angry tone, "Go from here now, meet me in the quarter
in the evening."
Deep Narayanji and myself returned from Baba's place quickly.
I SURRENDER EVERYTHING TO BABA AND HE BECOMES PLEASED WITH ME
Even today I get frightened when I remember that mood of Baba. All the way
back I was pondering also what I have done to make Him angry. I straightaway went to
Bindeshwariji's house and sitting in the small outside room began to ponder about what
mistake that I had committed to make Baba angry. I thought and thought but could not
locate the cause. I sat in the room and pondered and mentally prayed to Baba, "Baba
at any cost to me, kindly change this mood of Yours. I did not come to Your shelter to
see You in this mood." After this I mentally offered to Him one by one all the things and
relations which I held dear in this world and at each offering continued to pray, “Baba,
may You take all these and be pleased with me."
During this process I remembered that I had adamantly requested Baba for the
protection of my official position. I was so attached to my official position that I had
even discarded Baba’s own recommendation to accept a demotion. Now I said
mentally "Baba You may take away this also if it please You; I shall feel gratified if you
somehow feel pleased with me again." This was my last offering.
Meanwhile the elder brother of Bindeshwariji came and enquired what I was
doing sitting alone in that dark room? What is the time? I looked at my watch and told
him that it was five o'clock. During winters in December even at five in the evening it
starts growing dark. I was standing outside the room and talking to him, but my mind
was dominated by Baba's angry mood.In the evening at seven I reached the railway quarter again. Before Baba
arrived, the senior brother who stayed there told me that Baba is angry on the account
of smoking in this house. I though that if this was the reason of Baba's anger, I shall
give up smoking from today itself. Since that day I have never smoked again.
Baba came to the quarter and sat for a long time. Not to speak of talking to me,
He did not even look at me. That day Baba did not go for His field walk. When He
started from the quarter, we also followed Him.
Summoning some courage I asked, “Baba, have I committed any mistake that
has made you angry with me?”
Baba said, “At that time in the house I was upset. Now since five o’clock I am
no longer angry with you. Look at yourself - how far are you from death?”
I said, "Baba, for the last two months I have been trying to ask about this and
running here all the time to do so, but finding You always busy I could not do so".
Baba said, “I instructed you to protect yourself from dust and smoke but you did
not so.”
I said, “Baba, I have tried to do so”.
After returning to the house I went to bed in the same worried state. Next day I
did not return and stayed over in Jamalpur again.
I DISCOVER MY FAULT AND BABA PUNISHES ME
That day when I met Pranayji, the senior disciple who lived in that quarter, he
told me, “One who practices pranayama breath control should keep away from
smoking. Baba told you to keep away from smoke, but you still continued to smoke.”
I told him, ”I never dreamt that keeping away from smoke meant not smoking. I
was under the impression that I should avoid smoke of coal etc. I am sorry that due to
my ignorance, Baba had to become angry with me. Now I shall never smoke, although
it would be quite painful to give it up.”
In the evening as usual, I started for Baba's darshan, but that day Baba had left
His home before we reached there and we met Him on the way. That day Baba was
walking faster, there was therefore no opportunity to touch His feet and do pranam. I
told Baba that He was walking so quickly I had not got an opportunity to touch His feet.
Hearing this Baba looked at me in great anger. I kept quiet.
After some time, Baba turned towards the railway quarter and we also
continued to follow Him. After reaching there Baba asked the senior disciple whether
he could take dictation. Baba's voice itself indicated how angry He was, so that brother
hesitated to reply.
I said, “'Give me pencil and paper. I shall take dictation."
When he gave me the pencil and paper, Baba sat on the wooden seat and we
sat down on the floor and I began to take dictation. Baba dictated:
“Punishment Notice No. 1
Nagina will not touch me till further order, nor he will participate in
Gurupuja”.In the notice Deep Narayanji and some others were also punished - which is not
necessary to mention here. I used to consider myself a very fast writer, but that day I
was disabused of this impression of mine. And since that day my speed of writing also
declined.
Then Baba started for His walk and we also followed Him. In the field Baba sat
on the tiger’s grave. Everyone sat around Him but I sat at some distance.
After some time Baba enquired, "Nagina, why are you sitting at such a
distance?"
Before I could reply Baba said, "That is alright”. I did not have to say anything.
At about nine thirty, when Baba rose, everyone did sastaunga pranam to Him. I
was standing somewhat away and enquired whether I could also prostrate myself at
His feet.
He said, "Yes, you can do pranam”.
I did my sastaunga pranam from some distance and returned.
Vishvanathji was both a childhood friend and classmate and was quite pained
to see me punished, as he thought that he was cause of this punishment. I explained to
him that this kind of thinking was simply superstition and entirely baseless. Still it took
him some time to get over his sense of guilt.
Next day, after returning to Begusarai when I sat for my meditation, I did not
know whether in the dhyana lesson I was to touch Baba or not. I had not been taught
guru puja up till then, so there was no difficulty in this regard. I therefore addressed a
letter to get clarification in this regard, and received a reply after about five or six days.
Until then I had stopped doing dhyana.
As far as I remember on 29th December 1954 I received the reply from Baba,
“In no circumstances should you allow the sanctity of the Ashram to be destroyed."
Only now I understood that Baba had given that quarter the status of an
ashram. My senior brother disciples had never informed me about it.
Following this punishment I began to feel quite frightened and nervous. Fear
had already been a dominant tendency in my mind, but now this increased further.
Even Baba appeared quite frightening. I used to get nightmares.
It was at this time that my little daughter Mainju, whom Baba had revived from
death, began to sing a song as she waited at the gate each day for me to return from
the office: " Oh Lord, how much has man changed." I used to feel quite frightened
hearing this song from her little mouth.
And so 1954 ended in this state of fear and 1955 arrived.
