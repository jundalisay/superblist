[An Editor’s note in Prajina Bharati October 1983]

There has been some confusion regarding two previous births of Baba:
- in a family of a Muslim fakir and
- as Ram Chandra Upadhyaya. 

Actually, **Anandamurtiji and Prabhat Ranjain Sarkar are two different entities**. 

These two births have been referred to Shrii Prabhat Ranjain Sarkar. 

Baba writes that Taraka Brahma is a devotional concept. 
- Shrii Shrii Anandamurtiji is the Taraka Brahma. 

<!-- The author of Ananda Katha has given a very nice clarification on this subject. I shall try to publish the translation of
his clarification in the subsequent issue of Prajina Bharati.
Thanking you,

Appendix Two
A clarification by Naginaji
English translation of a letter written in Hindi dated 9.7.83 from Shrii Nagina to the
Editor of Ananda Yuga. Published in Prajina Bharati December 1983. -->

Dear Editor,

Namaskar,

In the ninth installment of ‘Ananda Katha published in your esteemed journal ‘Ananda Yuga’ for the month of May-June 1983 at page 19 under head Namami Baba Jagatharnam Vishwarupam I have mentioned about the previous 2 lives of Baba as He told to me  in 1955 at Jamalpur.

This act was given under inverted commas only with a view that everyone should know that it
was revealed by Reverend Baba Himself, and nothing was added to it by me. Even
then I learn that this statement of fact has hurt the sentiments of some of my brothers
despite my best efforts to reproduce it in the same words of Reverend Baba.

You know perfectly well that I am neither a writer nor a critic. Naturally I don’t
have the required knowledge of writing and that too, about Revered Baba. With this
view in my mind I requested you in the very beginning to spare me from this
responsibility of writing “Ananda Katha and to leave it as my treasure: but you were not at all prepared to extend any realisation to your order and finding no way out I had to comply. You also insisted and wanted me to write in Hindi only as Reverend Baba always used to talk with me in Hindi. You were of the opinion that translation in any other language would not have been a faithful reproduction of Baba’s dialogue. 

I admit that there might be some faults in my art of writing and language but so far the facts relating to Revered Baba are concerned I cannot even imagine of any deviation.Last time, when you met me, you were kind enough to make a reference about the previous two lives of Revered Baba and consequently, about hurting the sentiments
of some of the Margii brothers when are so sincerely devoted to Revered Baba I tried my best to clarify the position and I felt you were convinced of the clarifications given by me. 

You left my place fully satisfied. But in absence of any clarification published so far, some more brothers expressed their views of not relishing and approving the idea of publishing the previous lives of Revered Baba. 

It was conveyed to me twice by one Shrii Ramswarnathji and once by Acarya Shrii Vishwanathji of Muzaffarpur. 

Matters relating to Reverend Baba said in all good faith and with full of reverence, will at all be a subject matter of discussion. 

I never thought of. I felt, it was really unfortunate. I admit that I am completely devoid of any higher spiritual realization karma (action) jinana (knowledge) and bhakti (devotion) but still some definite and pertinent questions have cropped up in my mind on hearing that my writings have hurt the Sentiments of my brothers. These questions deserve a serious thought and they are:

1. Whatever I have reproduced about the previous 2 lives of Revered Baba was confirmed by Baba Himself.

 <!-- and this was why His sessions were given under inverted commas.  -->

For disciples it is said in shastras that ‘Mantramulam Gururvakyam’, and will such discussions and talks of hurting the
sentiments on the sayings of Revered Baba be in accordance with His honour?

2) Should the historical fact be ignored only because it may hurt the sentiments of someone?

3) During Emergency, very many excesses were done to the Marga and to Baba by the government itself. 

Such indigents of excesses must have offended very much the feelings of every Margii brother. Will such incidents be removed from the History of Ananda Marga only because it would hurt the sentiments of the Margii brothers?

4) At times, some disciples of Baba due to their very earnest and intense sadhana take Baba bhava and start feeling themselves to have become Baba Anandamurtiji.

Does it mean that they will also be called Mahakaul and Mahasambhuti like Revered Baba Anandamurtiji? If not, will it not hurt their sentiments too?

5) Why some of the speeches (pravacan), compiled in forms of books of Reverend Baba are published in the name of Shrii Shrii Anandamurtiji while others in the name of Shri Prabhat Rainjan Sarkar?

6) In Margiya News and Notices appearing on the 3rd cover page of the 2nd issue of Ananda Duta published in 1956 it, has been said, “ It is a matter of great honour that Shri Prabhat Rainjan Sarkar has been pleased to take over as president of AMPS. 

Because of paucity of time the ex-President Shrii Shrii Anandamurtiji was pleased to withdraw Himself form pracar
work and directed Shrii Sarkar to accept the post of the President. Does it not need
to clarify the distinction?

7) If you could put a little bit of strain on your memory, you will please recollect that sometimes possibly in fifties the Revered Baba was pleased to issue a circular direction Shrii Prabhat Rainjan to take over all types of Marga. (I am not in a
position to give you a copy of that circular at this late stage.

So if there are some fault in my language, I may be excused) Who so? Does it not need to clarify the
distinction?
8) Whether Taraka Brahma, Mahakaul, Mahasambhuti and Revered Baba
Anandamurtiji are a person or a Supreme Entire or both if He is a Supreme Entity.
Where comes the question of hurting the sentiments of Baba's devotees?
9) It is the vanii of Revered Baba that He had been a mystery in past, He is a mystery
for the present and will remain a Mystery in the future. If so, where comes the
question of hurting the sentiments on attainment of perfection of Shri Ram
Chandraji Upadhyaya and again taking birth as a Muslim fakir? His ways arealways mysterious.
10) Is it not a fact that Taraka Brahma when becomes the Mahasambhuti, the
Mahakaul and Most Revered Baba Anandamurtiji, He needs a vishes adhar
(special base) in the form of a human body?

Please see revered Baba’s pravacan delivered in July 1967 at Delhi under Head Sambhuti and Mahasambhuti appearing in:
A-Bodhi Kalpa in January 1968 at Pages 11.20 Reference of vishes adhar at
page 18
B-Ananda Duta of May 1971 at pages 20.29. Reference of vishes adhar
svpecially at page 27.

In this pravacan Revered Baba has said very specifically and clearly about the vishes adhar (Special base). When Mahasambhuti definitely needs vishes adhar in human form, where comes the question of hurting the sentiment?

11) When Taraka Brahma needs vishes adhar (special base) to express Himself as
Mahasambhuti, Mahakaul and Revered Baba Anandamurti should the vishes adhar
not be equally sanctified, holy suspicious, sacred and divine? If it is so how does it
hurt the Sentiments of Margiis brothers if Shri Ram Chandraji Upadhyaya attained
perfection and again came as a Muslim fakir does?

12) When it takes several thousand years for Taraka Brahma to came as
Mahasambhuti, Mahakaul and Baba Anandamurtiji is it not necessary for the vishes
adhar to take at least two lives for sadhaka siddha to become fully seasoned,
sanctified, and divine to withstand the force of power energy (shakti) and effulgence
of Mahasambhuti, the Revered Baba Anandamurtiji.

13) In Bodhikalpa of January 1975 at Pages 35-37 Late Acarya Shri Amitanandaji
Avadhuta has given some incidents as told to him by the Revered Baba personally
relating to His own self at Ananda Nagar. This has been published under head ‘The
Unresolved Mystery’ in which he has reproduced the words of Baba. This is an
article, which in my humble opinion should not only be read and memorised but
also digested and assimilated by every devotee. In one of the paragraphs of the
said article the Reverend Baba says, "I have gone to Jamalpur hill for doing
sadhana.” I am sitting at a particular place when someone tells in my ears, “come
with me. I will show you a better place for sadhana. Follow me”. I see no one but I
follow the voice whose presence I feel so clearly. The voice takes me to another
place and asks me to do sadhana. After a while it tells me. “ Are you mad? Don’t be
in Maya Are you P.R. Sarkar? See who you are! “ And a reel of my past life, my
earlier lives, flashes clearly before my eyes and I realise who I am. There are
several such paragraphs of interest in this article.
With these sayings of Baba where comes the question of hurting the sentiments of any
brother Margii? I pray, may this saying of Revered Baba act as healing balm for those
whose sentiments I am accused of hurting.

14) In Ananda Rekha of May-June 1981, Revered Baba’s pravacan has appeared
under head “Mahasambhuti vishwa men kab ate hain”. (When the Mahasambhuti
comes in the Universe). In this pravacan, Revered Baba has said, “When the
affairs are completely out of control and sin enters into every bit of the Society ... in
such circumstances Parama Purusa becomes helpless to take human body (five
rudimentary form)”. In views of this is it possible for the Parama Purusa to accept
the ordinary adhar? No, never. The adhar must be vishes (special) If so why should
it hurt the sentiments?

15) At page 21 of Ananda Rekha July -August 1981 the great devotee of our most
Revered Baba Shri Sahadevji has written under the head, “Vacanamrta” with
reference to Shri Shyamacaran Lahiriji, that the yogi said, "Tathastu" (Let it be so),
"Pratikasha karo" (wait). Who was the yogi of Drongiri? Is it not a mystery? If it is
so, how the Mahasambhuti or the Mahakaul came here? It is an incident of the year1851.
16) Please see at pages 19 22 of Ananda Yuga for the month of Sept. 1981. Acarya
Shri Raghunathji has written under the heading, "Mahasambhuti ka liila vilas", that
the Taraka Brahma has no form and shape and He taken His form of
Pancamahabhuti as per His will (svasamkalpit). Here it is His will and will alone
according to which He takes his body. How will it hurt the sentiments?
17) In this context I would invite your attention to the pravacan of our most Revered
Baba appearing in Ananda Yuga of October 1981 under the heading, "Taraka
Brahma, ka avirbhava", page 31, 33. In this pravacan Revered Baba has said that
Parama Purusa, to express Himself, comes under the parameter of desh (place)
kal (time) and rupa (subject), and that after taking the human form becomes nearer
to us. In view of this how I am responsible for hurting the feeling of my brothers?

18) Kindly see at pages 35, 38 of Ananda Rekha for the month of September – October
1981, "Baba Ka Antaryamitva", written by a sadhaka. At page 38 it has appeared
that revered Baba told that while doing Dharma Samiksa of His disciples, He had to
perform at least four roles at a time i.e. of Shri P.R. Sarkar, Baba, Sadguru and
Anandamurtiji. It becomes really very difficult to make adjustments in all the four
roles. Revered Baba had to perform the liila of Kalyanasundaram and Rudrah. All
the four are so intermingled with one another that it is very difficult to make any
distinction”. In view of this, can’t it be concluded that all the four roles of Baba are
one and the same force?

19) At Page 19 of Ananda Yuga for the for the month of October-November-December
1982, at times it appeared that the Reverend Baba brought His right foot between
both His palms and said twice, “I am perfectly alright”. It is a mystery for me till
today as to who was catching whose foot, and so to whom He was addressing and
speaking? I shall be highly grateful if the brothers whose sentiments I hurt, of
course unknowingly, clarify this mystery to me.

20) At page 15 of Ananda Yuga for the month of March-April 1983, has appeared that
the Most Reverend Baba commanded to His own Self, saying, “Prabhat Rainjan
Sarkar! You regain your health for sometime as you have to go to the field”. This is
again a mystery for me as to who was that super Entity to command Shri Prabhat
Rainjan (Reverend Baba) to go to the field and it did not take even a moment for
the lifeless body of Shri Sarkar to obey and comply with the order. It would really be
a great kindness to me to clarify as to who commanded whom?
21) At page 24 of Ananda Yuga for the month of May-June 1983, it has appeared that
“at times Reverend Baba had to take two different bodies for one and the same day
to protect His disciple”. Definitely it is a very ordinary liila for Reverend Baba. In
view of this what difference does it take if Shri Ram Chandraji Upadhyaya attained
perfection with the body and also took the body of a Muslim fakir in next life? How
does it hurt the sentiments?
22) The Taraka Brahma as Mahasambhuti has always been addressed by Rishis,
Maharishis and Vedas as limitless (neti neti). Has He now come under limitations
and become knowable?
I am sorry the letter has become very lengthy and hence I stop giving further reference
With Baba Nam Kevalam

I am ever your
