LETTER TO THE EDITOR

Dear Shri Editor,

I have gone through the letters to the Editor’ column published in your esteemed magazine, Prajina Bharati, for the month of February, 1984, Unfortunately, I could no go through it earlier because of its late arrival and hence I am late in sending
my reply.

Regarding the Ananda Katha series, so far it had only been the question of hurting the sentiments of my fellow Margii brothers, but now Acarya Shri Hari Shamkarji has outright doubted the very truthfulness of the facts contained in A’nanda Katha. He says
in his letter that the prime question is not one of hurting the feelings of devotees, but of
recording satya for the benefit of posterity.

When he taken this statement of facts, particularly those told by Reverend Baba Himself about Shri Ram Chandra Upadhyayaji as not satya, he has the full privilege of treating the whole of Ananda Katha as asatya (not satya) However, how can it be partly
satya and partly asatya? 

To be very frank, I cannot force him to accept it as Satya, although in the same letter he both praises my contribution and complains about my not recording Satya. It appears like he is blowing both hot and cold air simultaneously
in the same breath.

You will please agree with me that, like Hari Katha, Ananda Katha is also Ananda. Even if thousands of crores of people like me write Ananda Katha, still it will remain mysterious, unresolved and incomplete. If what Reverend Baba has said is not
satya, then what else is satya? 

In that case it is better of Acarya Shri Hari Shankarji takes the trouble to tell us what is the satya. Is it not a fact that we address Shrii Shrii Anandamurtiji, who is Taraka Brahma, Mahasambhuti and Mahakaul expressed in the
form of Prabhat Rainjan, as Baba?

Is it at all possible to separate Shrii Shrii Anandamurtiji from the present form of Prabhat Rainjan? It cannot be denied that we
know Shrii Shrii Anandamurtiji only through the present from of Shrii Shrii Prabhat
Rainjanji. So any controversy becomes meaningless.

Even though a voluminous thesis can be written in support of my contentions on each point mentioned in my letter dated 9.7.83 and duly published in the December 1983 issue of your magazine) still then Acarya Shri Hari Shankarji considers it to be asatya.

Thus in my humble opinion, there remains only 3 alternatives, which are as follows:

1. He should get matters questionable to himself confirmed directly from Baba Himself and set the issue at rest for good, without making it unnecessarily controversial any more.

2. If he can believe the major portion of Ananda Katha to be Satya, he must also believe that the portion in goes from is equally Satya.

3. IF he deems at as fit and necessary, he should declare that portion of Ananda Katha as outright untrue and false, and forbid me from predicting it any further. I assure him with humility and humbleness that if true. I will stop it forthwith. But I would like to report very sincerely that he is no way until this is determined confuse and confoundthe issue any further He has the right to brand me a liar but he should not doubt the
sayings of Reverend Baba.

I am not even well versed in my mother tongue, let alone in a foreign language like English. So I could not exactly follow what he meant by the term communication gap. 

This needs elucidation for my understanding.

For me, philosophy is a very terse, difficult, and not-easily adaptable subject.
But what little bit I could and did learn about philosophy, sitting under the lotus feet of
Reverend Baba, Taraka Brahma, is beyond the scope of philosophy. Taraka Brahma,
or Brahma in any form (be it saguna or nirguna) can be better realized than justified or
declined through philosophy. You will very humbly agree that ultimately he is beyond
the scope of language and philosophy both. In paragraph two (2) of his letter, Acaryaji,
Hari Shankar has defined the Taraka Brahma as He who takes human form after
assigning a role for Himself. I never differ with him, but it is completely the prerogative
and supreme wish of he Taraka Brahma for selecting choosing, and taking human form
to express himself when he intends to come on earth. His reason for choosing a
particular human form cannot be questioned or challenged, also his scope in beyond
the limits and capabilities of our quite limited and small human minds.
Lastly, I would like to let everybody know, including Acarya Shri Hari Shankarji, that I
am no longer an acarya. The word acarya is very, very dignified and honorable, and so
it is my humble request that, if by mistake, someone uses it before my name, that you
remove it before publishing. In that way, we may preserve the sanctity of the word.
With Baba Nam Kevalam
Yours very truly
Sd. Nagina
