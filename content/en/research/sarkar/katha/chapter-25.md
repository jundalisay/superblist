Most of the things about Baba’s childhood and adolescence are recorded in a
booklet called “ Baba” and in the periodical called “Shankhanand” in an article under
the legend “The Avatar of Param Purush”. Even so during my stay at Jamalpur, what
ever I came to know from older and most senior Margiis about Baba’s early life is being
narrated below.

Baba was taking pure sattvika food since His childhood. Even though
the guardians tried otherwise Baba never accepted tamasika food. His family and his
father had lot of goodwill and fame in Jamalpur. Therefore, most of the familiar is
Jamalpur knew Him and his family very well.

Baba was strong to determination, fearless and justice loving since his boyhood. As a child He had to live with a Bhojpuri speaking family for some time, hence, even now Baba shows special interest in Bhojpuri language. Even as a boy he
could not relocate injustice with anyone and discipline was a part of his life. He was so
fearless that even as a child He would wander for hours in the dense forest of
Jamalpur. He was always most popular amongst His classmates and friends He had a
special interest in Sanskrit and social service all through.

As a boy he had translated the Mahabharat from Samskrta to Bengali. He was the leader in academic interests and games even since His boyhood and kept everyone under His discipline. In the earthquake of 1934 even as a boy he had
assisted his father in his social service with devotion and interest. His father died
untimely after the earthquake. Although the reverent mother was looking after the
family even so being the eldest in the family, the responsibility for the upkeep of the
family came to him.

After His matriculation Baba’s mother sent Him to Calcutta where he passed his
Arts Examination while staying with his maternal undress family.
During his stay in Calcutta. He gave his first initiation to Kalikanandaji in 1939
th
on the day of the full moon of the 7 month of Shravan. That is why we celebrate this
Purnima as Guru Purnima. Although it was against the wishes of Baba’s mother, yet
Baba, after His Intermediate Examination, joined service in the accounts branch of the
Railways at Jamalpur Here in Jamalpur, Baba kindly initiated Shrii Hara Prasadji of
Krshnanagar in 1945 and the first General Secretary of the Marga, P.K. Chatterjee, in
1949.
Although Baba was highly devoted to his mother, yet in spite of her wishes to
the contrary and keeping the responsibility for be family in view, joined service. His
mother wanted that He should continue His studies further. As the whole arrangement
for the family was in the hands of His mother Baba would give away his entire salary to
mother every month. From whatever pocket money was given to Him by his mother, He
would serve the needy or purchase fruits and flowers for his mother. His life was very
much disciplined in his house and the family. This had its effect on the younger brother
too. Baba has always been the most beloved in his family and relations. After
sometime his younger brother also joined the railway office at Jamalpur. Now Baba
would not even take his salary from the office. He had authorized his younger brother
to receive his salary on His behalf. In the office, Baba was mostly known as an expertsoothsayer and Tantric. Some people even used to call him a “Living Encyclopedia”.
Whenever anyone had to know something on any subject they would approach Him.
Baba would finish his office work much before it was due and in His spare time
used to teach morality to his acquaintances. There were some non-Margiis in Baba’s
office who were quite interested in morality and they were all liked by Baba. Amongst
favorites the name of Shrii Shankar Mukherjee and that of Shrii Vimal Chandra Mitra
are of especial mention.
In administrative and disciplinary matters, Baba was always very strict. Finding
Baba always in a blissful mood, one gentleman in his office gave Him the name of
Anandamurtiji and Baba had gladly accepted that name. This gentleman had special
interest in the scriptures and whenever he got an opportunity he would discuss the
subject of scripture with Baba. Baba had pointed out that this gentleman had a good
knowledge of Sanskrit also. Baba had given the name of that gentleman also but it has
now slipped from my memory after all these years.
As time passed the third and the fourth brothers of Baba also joined service. By
now Baba was also guiding the work of the Marga along with his family responsibilities.
But as all His brothers had joined service, Baba could give more time to the affairs of
the Marga, and after some time He resigned from service and devoted His entire time
for the Marga.
Although Baba’s mother is no longer alive, yet the brothers and sisters of Baba
do visit Him now and then. In family life also Baba is very practical and never gives
opportunity to anyone to complain of any lapse of duty on any occasion.
