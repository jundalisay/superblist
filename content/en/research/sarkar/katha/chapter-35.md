It was decided to hold a Dharma Mahacakra at Gorakhpur on the occasion of
the full-moon day of the month of Ashada I could not attend due to the illness of my
mother and my wife.

Baba had gone to Gorakhpur from Jamalpur via broad gauge through Varanasi
but he was returning from by the meter gauge train. Thus I was bound to touch Hajipur
on his way from the DMC. The train used to reach Hajipur after 9. p.m. I therefore said
that I would arrange dinner for Baba and other Margii brothers returning from
Gorakhpur along with Baba in the evening and over the foodstuffs to the assistant
secretary at Hajipur so that they may not feel inconvenienced on the train on the
journey. Moreover, the train reached at about dinnertime.
I started the arrangements for Blissful Baba and the Margii brothers’ dinner.
Obstacles also began to appear in their bulk as soon as I began the arrangements. At
about eleven in the morning my domestic assistant came to inform me that my wife’s
condition had suddenly deteriorated. I had just arranged for a doctor and medicines for
her when I was informed that the 20 kilos of milk bought in the morning for making
sweets had gone sour at about 2 p.m. I was quite depressed but my domestic assistant
and aunt did not feel so disheartened. They suggested that milk could be obtained
again in the evening from a neighboring village. They were determined to prepare good
and tasty food for Baba and the Margii brothers accompanying Him.

As we were discussing these arrangements, some four or five Margii brothers
arrived from Muzaffarpur. I was very happy to meet them; but my house in Hajipur was
very small. It was with great difficulty that I was pulling on therein with the members of
my family. Now, I had to make arrangements for their night halt also I requested the
guest brothers to adjust themselves to the conditions we were in. I asked my domestic
assistant to arrange for their food and night half. After freeing myself form them, I sent
my servant to the neighboring village in the evening to purchase more milk. By six in
the evening my wife’s conditions improved. Milk also came by about the same time.
Now hope returned that we should be able to do some thing for the dinner of the Lord,
who feeds this universe. But obstacles did not leave me alone even now.

My aunt was very much perturbed and she informed me that my second son
Mohan had vomited thrice and had also shown signs of loose motions. He and become
quite weak and the doctor had to be called immediately. I sent for the doctor and began
to pray to Baba whether the stream of these difficulties was going to dry up or not?
Mentally I said, “Baba do you not accept my arranging dinner for you and the
Margiis tonight? What fault has been committed by me that even this small service
from me is not acceptable? Have I no claim on even such a small service? O Lord who
keeps the honour of they devotees, pray accept my invitation and let me arrange this
small service for you! Kindly do not take away this good fortune of mine to serve you
and your devotees. Oh Lord! Be pleased to enable me to serve you this night.”
As I was praying thus, the homeopathic doctor who was treating my wife and
my son came. He examined my son and assured me that he would be all right very
soon. He stayed over in my house and began to administer medicines to my son at
short intervals. Now my son’s conditions improved and his vomiting and loose motions
stopped.The doctor also examined my wife and changed the medicine for her, as there
was an improvement in her condition. This second medicine brought miraculous
improvement in her condition. My domestic assistant took his bath and got ready to
help my son.

By now my aunt had also cleaned and washed the oven and the cooking
utensils and was preparing food for Baba and the Margii brothers. My wife also took
her bath and entered the kitchen to cook for Baba. Compassionate Baba heard and
answered my prayers and things began to move in a systematic manner.
At about eight I called the railway station and enquired whether the train was in
time. The Railway Enquiries Office informed me that the train was about one hour late.
I gave my phone number to the Enquiry and requested them to inform me about forty-
five minutes before the arrival of the train. They assured compliance of my request.
By nine-thirty whatever was prepared was packed neatly in big wooden tiffin
boxes well washed and cleaned for the purpose and in some baskets made of bamboo.
As the train was about to arrive, all of us took up the packets and started for the station
to have Baba’s darshan.

The Margiis of Hajipur were already at the station. I also reached there along
with the Margii brothers from Muzaffarpur. There was quite a crowd of devotees at
Hajipur station. Soon Baba’s train came in. It appeared to me as if the train was made
to come late by Baba purposely to enable me to get the dinner ready. Had the train
come on time our preparations would have remained incomplete. This was a great
blessing of Baba on a poor devotee like me.

As the train entered the platform, heart-rending sounds of Victory to the
Supreme Lord of Yoga Shrii Shrii Anandamurtiji” filled the air. The attending secretary
opened the door of Baba’s compartment. All the Margii brothers were overwhelmed
with devotional fervour. Then they began to enter the compartment one by one in a
disciplined manner. Meanwhile I handed over to the attending secretary the tiffin boxes
and baskets carrying food for Baba and the Margiis. I requested Him most humbly that
Baba’s and the Margiis dinner may be served out of this food.

After that I was standing in one corner with a garland in my hands to be offered
to Baba. I was looking at Him, but due to the crowd in between was unable to reach
him. The Margii brothers who had the compartment stayed there. Thus there was so
much rush inside the compartment. Baba noted my helplessness and extended both
his hands and took up the garland from my hands and placed the same on his neck. I
was overwhelmed; my heart began to pound. Due to excess emotion, tears began to
flow from my eyes and I became dumb. Baba then called me near and I had the
opportunity to touch his lotus feet. Great is Baba’s grace.

Although we were so unwilling to leave him, the train started moving slowly.
Baba instructed me to get down. I came home in the same ecstatic condition. After this
I shared my dinner with the guests from Muzaffarpur.
We spent almost the whole night talking of great Baba and events in our lives
connected with Him. In the morning after taking their bath and breakfast these Margiis
returned to Muzaffarpur.

After some days I came to know from the manager of the ashram that the food
delivered by me was taken by Baba and all the other Margiis with great pleasure. It was
also used for breakfast the next morning. The inhabitants of Jamalpur ashram used
what was still left thereafter. On receiving this information, the members of my familyand I felt extremely happy and contented. Baba's liila is great. He first presents
obstacles to test the sincerity of the devotee and thereafter arranges all facilities
himself.
My prayer to the Lord is that he may take whatever test he wants, but the
should never allow my faith to be shaken. This much grace I shall pray for all my life.
Our pracar work in Hajipur was going on smoothly. Shri Shankar Swaroop
Singh, who was an Inspector in my department, meanwhile got transferred to Hajipur.
He had worked with me before also during the period 1948-50. At that time I was not in
the Marga. He had witnessed my “eat, drink and be merry” life at that time. This time he
found some change in my views, habits of eating and ways of life. Therefore after
working for some time, he asked to be initiated.
So far, I was not initiating people in my own department. But when another
acarya was not available, I had to initiate them myself. Here Acarya Deep Narainji was
available. I, therefore, requested him to initiate Shri Sinha and he was initiated in 1958.
He started regular sadhana after initiation. His respect for his acarya and attachment to
sadhana began to grow steadily. Now be became keen to have Baba's darshan. As his
sadhana improved, his devotion to Baba also began to increase. He got his first
darshan of Baba on the occasion of Ramnagar DMC.
