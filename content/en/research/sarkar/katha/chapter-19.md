It was the summer of 1955. As usual I was with Baba that day on his evening walk. 

I saw a big crowd emerging from a temple nearby.

{{< r a="Nagina" >}}
When will so many people gather at our festivities in the Marga?
{{< /r >}}

{{< r a="Baba" >}}
You will soon see even bigger crowds in your festivities also. But Nagina, after some time, you people will be afraid to call yourself a Margii.
{{< /r >}}

Then Baba began to laugh.

{{< r a="Baba" >}}
Such a time will come when the purohit (Hindu priest), the maulvi
(Muslim cleric), the priest and the government and all political parties will oppose
Ananda Marga intensely and jointly and will blame you people for all sorts of things.
They will not do so-because of defects or faults in your people, but they will do so
because your ideal and moral principles will directly hit their selfish interests. But such
adverse times will not last long. Although you people will always be required to struggle
but you will be able to construct a strong social order in future which will look after the
requirements of all the sections of society. This will be the ‘Sadvipra Samaj.’

After about ten years things began to take a turn in the direction, Baba had indicated. It reached its climax in June 1975
when during the state of emergency during which all opposition parties were banned,
parliament was suspended, Ananda Marga was one amongst many social organizations also banned.


I SEEK BABA’S PERMISSION FOR THE FIRST ANANDA PURNIMA CELEBRATION

In the end of the second week of April respected Shri Chandranathji took the
trouble of coming to the residence of Bindeshwari Singh along with two or three other
brother disciples. He said that he had some work with me and I requested to kindly let
me know what I could do for him.
Chandranathji said, “Baba's birthday falls in May and we want to celebrate it
with great enthusiasm and gusto this time.”
I agreed that this was an excellent idea, and asked what I could do to assist in
this. He said that they had all requested Baba’s permission many times, but that He
was not agreeing to the celebrations this year. I asked why Baba was not giving
permission, but they said that this was something known only to Baba Himself. I
suggested that we should again press Baba to agree, and Chandranathji said that they
had done all they could do about it, and now I should request Baba.
I said, “When Baba has not agreed on your request, how will He now listen to
me?”At this, Chandranathji replied that a similar thing that happened about the
initiation of Nand Kishore Babu. He had tried his best to secure Baba’s permission but
had failed, and when he asked me to request Baba to initiate him, Baba gave His
consent.
Again I demurred, saying, “When Baba is not giving his consent on requests
from senior brothers like you there is little hope that my request will make a difference.”
But Chandranathji asked me to request Baba when I accompanied Him for His
evening walk. When I kept quiet, he asked me to try at least once. I agreed to try and
make the effort that same day.
In the evening while walking I entreated Baba, “This time we want to celebrate
Guru Purnima on the occasion of your birthday and I have been entrusted to obtain
your permission in this regard.”
Baba said, "You could start it from next year, but not this year".
Again I asked Baba, “We want to start it from this year itself.”
Baba said, "Look, little time is left now, and you people will not be able to
prepare well during this period now so I am saying that this should be done next year.”
By now we had reached the tiger’s grave, and after Baba took His seat I again
opened the subject. "Baba may be we may not be able to prepare very well but we do
not want to celebrate on that day". In this manne I continued to press for Baba's
consent.
I said, "Baba already 364 days in the year are Yours and on the day of Your
birth we disciples want to have our say and celebrate. We shall therefore celebrate it as
well as we can. This is a day of great rejoicing for all the disciples. Kindly just give Your
permission. Do not put any restrictions regarding this day”.
Baba said, "Would you able to celebrate?"
I said, "Why not Baba! We shall celebrate."
Baba thereafter said, "All right if you can, then do celebrate.”
I was extremely happy on hearing these words and asked Baba whether I could
inform the other disciple brothers about this permission.
Baba said, "Yes, you can do so". I felt fulfilled and informed the others about it.
Salutations to Baba who is the Bestower of Salvation
BABA ORDERS ME HOME TO SEE MY FAMILY
Following this, one evening in the third week of April I was going for a walk with
Baba and He said, "Nagina, it is many days since you have gone home. It would be
good if you visit your home soon. You have not seen the members of your family for a
long time - this visit will enable you to do that also."
I said, "Baba, I shall go after the Guru Purnima celebration."Baba said "There is yet time for that and you can go home and return after
meeting everybody there."
Vaeshakhii Purnima was at the end of the first week of May. I thought that there
was time and thought that as Baba had asked me to got why should I not pay a quick
visit? So, following Baba's instructions I set out for home. There I met my father.
My parents were extremely happy to see me. As there were educational
difficulties in my home village, my father said he had sent my family to Siwan where my
wife and children were staying with my younger brother. After staying one day with my
parents, my father asked me to go to Siwan to see my family.
Following my father’s instructions, I left for Siwan. When I touched my father's
feet to take his leave - father was over powered with emotion. He began to weep and
his voice choked. I asked if I should cancel my visit to Siwan. But he said that I should
go with pleasure. He also instructed that if possible before returning to Jamalpur I
should also go to Delhi to find out what happened to my second appeal? I agreed with
him.
MY FATHER’S DEATH
On the 20th April 1955 I reached Siwan and found that my wife and children
were happy and healthy. My younger brother was out of station but he returned the
nd
next day. After staying there a couple of days I started for Delhi on the 22 April. My
younger brother requested me to drop at Chapra on the way as he had some work
there, which I could perform. On the same day I reached Chapra and was visiting a
friend of mine when I received a telephone call from my brother in Siwan informing me
that my father had expired that very day and I should reach home leaving all other
work. I could not believe the news as I had left father on the 19th in perfectly health. My
brother said that he had got the news confirmed, so, I immediately left Chapra for
home.
When I reached Sonepur, it came to my mind that there was a tradition in my
family to perform the last rites of the diseased at Hajipur Ghat, and that they may be
bringing my father's dead body to this site. I realised that if I travelled by rail I may
cross the cortege on the way, and I would not get a last sight of my father, so I left the
train at Hajipur and hired a taxi and started towards my home by road.
After travelling some 14-15 miles, I saw that a large number of persons were
walking with my father's dead body towards Hajipur. Amongst them there were some
very old men, so I sent them in the taxi and myself followed my father's dead body on
foot. After reaching Hajipur Konhara Ghat, we cremated the body there and returned
home. Shraddha was performed in the traditional way, as Baba had not yet given us
the book "Carya Carya" with the procedures for the last rites.
From the day of receiving the information about my father's death up to the day
of completion of the shraddha, it appeared as if prior arrangements had already been
made about all that I was required to do from time to time. As soon I would think of
something, arrangements would be made as if automatically. It appeared that my
thinking and actions had their source and control somewhere outside me.
By the time shraddha ceremony was complete. Vaeshakhii Purnima was past
and I could not participate in the celebrations. I was extremely unhappy that I could not
take part in this very first celebration of Baba’s birthday. I felt like weeping again and
again that day. My father expired at the age of sixty-one or sixty-two. Mostly people
had an impression that he passed away at a good age. Just second day after theshraddha, a singer came to my house after taking some rest he sang some devotional
songs. One of these songs was: -
Hari Om Hari Om
Mana tarapata Hari darshana ko ----
Tum bin bigare sagare ka ja
Binati karata hum rakhiya la ja
Mana tarapata......
He sang this song with such devotional melody that I began to weep
continuously. That day I wept so much that my eyes were raining like a monsoon cloud.
Those who saw me thought that this was happening because of the said demise of my
father. Of course, I was sad due to that also, but my sadness had increased manifold
due to my inability to partake of the Guru Purnima celebrations also.
My father was extremely fortunate as before his death he did not become
dependent on any of us and he died while in prayer. He died on the eleventh day of the
lunar month when he was fasting and while he was doing his puja.
After the shraddha, I was thinking one day about how unlucky I was that I could
not be present at the feet of my Guru on His birthday. Then I suddenly remembered
how, while giving me permission to celebrate Guru Purnima, Baba had asked whether I
would be able to celebrate it. How, after my entreaties He had given permission for the
celebrations to go ahead but in a manner that it may not be possible for me to make
the celebrations. At the time of giving the permission Baba had said, "All right celebrate
if you can."
The indication was adequate that I would not be able to celebrate, but at that
time I was not able to understand. I had no thought to come home, but this was also
due to Baba's instructions. Even then I did not know that Baba was sending me home
to have my last darshan of my father. It was a great kindness of Baba that he gave me
this chance. Otherwise, I could have regretted all my life.
I MISS THE DMC AND BABA SENDS HIS CONDOLENCES
On the fourth day after the Mahacakra, I received a letter. It came from my
senior brother disciple and was sent on the instructions from Baba. In the letter Baba
had sent his condolence on the death of my father. There was another thing in the
letter the reading of which moved me greatly.
My senior brother disciple had written that finding me absent from the
Mahacakra, Baba had said "Nagina's absence is something like performing a yajina,
where there may be no portion for Shiva." As I read this line, tears began to flow from
my eyes with great emotions and I felt uneasy to have Baba's darshan as soon as
possible.
Somehow I stayed two or three days more at home and thereafter leaving the
burden of the family on my younger brother, I came back to Jamalpur. I reached that
very evening Baba's residence for His darshan.
After my sastaunga pranam Baba said, "Nagina your father's work is complete."
I did not follow.
Baba said again "Seeing you extremely sad on the death of your father I did
your father's work. Now, he will not be required to take another birth."I folded my hands and expressed my gratitude, saying, “Baba you are great.”
Now, I realised why Baba had not initiated my father. He had put the condition
that my father would not ask other question except those relevant to initiation. Even
after knowing this condition, my father had other questions. Baba was kind enough to
reply those questions and my father was completely satisfied with those replies, but
when he requested for initiation, Baba said, “No, there is no need for your initiation.
Whatever you are doing is all right.”
Within almost a month of the darshan of Baba my father expired. Baba is
omnipotent and omniscient. He saw that the life of my father was about to come to an
end and therefore he did not initiate him. He would not have been able to do anything
even after taking the initiation as he had little time left in this life. Therefore, it was a
great grace of Baba that he granted liberation to my father. All praise to almighty Baba
who showers blessings on his disciples.
