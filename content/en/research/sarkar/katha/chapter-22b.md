That day Baba was extremely kind and he was pointing out some such things
about sadhana which are not only very useful to me but for all sadhakas, so I have
taken the freedom to write them down here. They appear very simple but are full of
great significance and value.

Baba said, “Sadhakas should convert their house and body into a temple. The
house will become a temple only when there are constant vibrations of sadhana in its
environment. Such an environment is only possible when all the residents of that house
perform sadhana everyday with sincerity and devotion. This is how a house can be
made into a temple. As regards the body, by following the eightfold path of sadhana
with devotion and faith and with regularity, this body is also converted into a temple.”
Baba further pointed out, “Every sadhaka should select a secluded spot in the
house where they may perform sadhana morning and evening. In the same way one
asan (mat) for one’s sadhana should also be fixed, which should not be used for other
purposes and people. Then one should also fix the time when one should sit down for
sadhana regularly. By following these instructions sadhana will always be of good
quality. As for the asan, either tiger skin or deerskin or a blanket, a mat, or a cotton
carpet will do. But one must always ensure that the asan should be a non-conductor of
heat otherwise the energy gained by sadhana will not be preserved as the earth is a
bad conductor of heat”.

Baba simplified the matter further by explaining, “Due to fixing the time, place and asan, the mind being familiar with that environment will be able to concentrate easily. Just as if your sleeping place and time are fixed you fall asleep as soon as you lie there. But if the place is changed or the bedding is not yours or has been changed
and the time is also not of your choice it will take time to fall asleep. The same is
applicable to sadhana also”.

“Sadhana should always be done in a peaceful and pleasant mood. One shouldnot do it when one is angry or dejected. In such a situation, all efforts to concentrate
the mind will be wasted”.

“You should sit in the lotus posture at the time of sadhana. The lotus posture
keeps one in a pleasant temper. You will find that one who is accustomed to do the
lotus posture will always be of an amicable temper. Do not touch anything like water up
to half an hour after sadhana – this will enable the energy created by sadhana not to
pass away in that medium. If due to some reason the mind does not concentrate on
some days, then given more time to the shuddhis, (withdrawal processes), this will
improve concentration”


## THE PROOF OF DIIKS’A AND MANTRA

That day Baba was bent upon explaining to me of dull intellect the specialties of sadhana. Baba knew that my mind was fond of logic and therefore, he was explaining the logic behind most of the process of sadhana. In this context, Baba explained how
you can know that the mantra given to you is correct and proper. I pleaded ignorance
and said that I only know how to repeat it in the given manner.

Baba said, " No you should know that you have the right mantra or not. Know the criteria for this. If there is growth in the situation and circumstances under which you took initiation then understand that the mantra is correct. Suppose you took
initiation in happy circumstances then the happiness should grow and if you received
initiation when the circumstances were painful then their intensity should grow this is
the test of a correct mantra.

The iista mantra acts like fire for the accumulated heap of your samskaras, which can be compared to gunpowder. Therefore the situation which was there at the time of initiation will be aggravated. In the extreme situation of either happiness or pain
there is a possibility of deviation from the path of sadhana. Therefore, in these situation
if one keeps contact with the guru, then one gets extra mental strength to bear the
development”.

In this regard I have a special experience that guru darshan also aggravates the samskaras, particularly the painful ones. They became explosive and the disciple begins to writhe with pain under their painful pressure. At times, the disciples, even the senior disciples, find themselves besieged with dangers and difficulties. The impending
adversities can begin to disturb their mental equilibrium. But this is also the time of test
for their courage and patience.

If they courageously and patiently continue to take the support of the guru and remain steadfast in their devotion and guru darshan, then certainly guru will give them the extra mental strength to bear the coming adversity.
Contact with the guru is beneficial in all circumstances. My own experience
points out that it is all the more so while one is in adversity. As I had little of worldly
pleasure I therefore unfortunately do not know the beneficial effects of guru’s contact
during happy times.



## THE CONSTANT PRACTICE OF IISTA MANTRA

Baba said about the iista mantra:

{{< l a="Baba" >}}
A sadhaka should constantly do the japa of iista mantra. The practice of this japa with the breath should be advanced to an extent that the body may be busy in any activity, but the mind will continue to repeat the iista mantra with every breath. When you are doing something. The eyes should remain open. 

Suppose you are going somewhere on foot or on a bicycle or in a car that you are driving yourself, if at that time you do the japa of iista mantra with closed eyes there may be an accident. Therefore while working, you will keep your eyes and japa will continue with the breathing. 
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Nagina" >}}
When one walks or cycles, the breath becomes irregular and therefore there is a disturbance in the japa also.
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Baba" >}}
In that situation, adjust the breath on the movement of right and left foot and then do the japa. This will protect the rhythm of the japa. One who is established in the practice of the iista mantra will die at his own wish only, and will
never die an accidental death.

There is nothing like an accident, in the sense that every event is an incident. 

Where people fail to locate the cause behind an event, they call it an accident. If it is difficult to concentrate, more time should be given to the shuddhis.

After receiving such detailed guidance, all my difficulties in the process of the japa of iista mantra disappeared.


{{< l a="Baba" >}}
The sadhana which has been taught to you is quite rational. Therefore, you should understand the logic behind its performance thoroughly.

Sadhana is a must in every one’s life. But before beginning, test it on the scale of reason as to why something should be done in one particular way only. When you completely understand the logic, your concentration will be perfect”.
{{< /l >}}

In those days, Baba was emphasising the logical aspect very much. 


{{< l a="Baba" >}}
The mind has 3 stages or layers: conscious, subconscious, and the unconscious. 

At the time of doing sadhana, you are hitting the conscious mind, when in this process the layer of the conscious mind
becomes subtle. The effect of this hitting of the mantra goes to the subconscious mind.
In this condition, the sadhaka starts hearing or seeing wonderful experiences and starts
feeling some kind of peace in the mind. 

By further regular practice of iista mantra, the subconscious mind also starts getting subtler, and the strokes of the mantra start affecting the unconscious mind. The sadhaka then starts knowing the events of the
future. 

Gradually, as one starts getting established in Iishvara pranidhana, one becomes omniscient”.
