The subject of discourse in the D.M.C. was ‘Samskaras and Liberation’.

<!-- Baba started his discourse. Every one’s eyes were centred on Baba’s face as he
developed the subject matter through his discourse. It appeared as if even the sight of
Baba had delivered everyone from mental distractions and that they had attained
perfect mental withdrawal. Now they became fully engrossed in their ‘Iista’. All were
one pointed and aborting Baba’s divine words in full concentration. -->

Baba’s voice was so sweet and thrilling that a lady devotee transcended her environment and rose to dance in a blissful state. The environment was now surcharged with powerful spiritual vibrations. It was the play of Baba. He stopped the
dance also in a most easy and playful manner. 

Without looking in the direction of the dancer, Baba moved his right hand in the posture of abhaya and moved the hand
upwards and downwards. As he did this that lady lay down and went into deep sleep
and could return to her normally only after the DMC and Baba and all the Margiis had
left the hall.

I saw that in this DMC the colour of Baba’s face was constantly changing according to the variation in the subject matter, which He was explaining in His discourse. I am unfortunate not to be one of those who remember the subject of the
discourse in detail.

After the completion of the discourse when Baba left for his evening walk, then
alone the crowd of spectators and listeners began to melt. After this a big crowd came
for taking initiation and the acaryas were busy the whole night giving initiations.
Now every Margii repaired to the place of his stay. Thereafter there was
common feast. After this some people went to bed and began talking about Baba and
others went to Baba’s residence to quench the thirst of their eyes with another glimpse
of Baba’s.

Here one word about Acarya Harprasadji: He is the senior most sadhaka and
acarya in the Marga. For his livelihood he was working in the workshop at Jamalpur
where he took initiation from Baba sometime in 1951 near about the full-moon day of
the month of Vaeshakh. I am recollecting his description as given by Baba when he
became acarya.

Like Lord Buddha, he was the first person to initiate his own father. When
Buddha returned to Kapilavastu the kingdom of his father after attaining enlightenment,
every member of his family was ready to be initiated by him. When the question of
initiating his son, Rahul arose, Buddha’s father himself became ready to be initiated
and he requested Lord Buddha not to initiate Rahul. If he also became a monk, the
king’s family tree would stop its growth. Therefore, he took initiation himself and
handed over the kingdom of Kapilavastu to Rahul.

But Acarya Hariprasadji explained the importance of sadhana and dharma to his father and when his father fully grasped its significance, he suggested to be initiated by his son. His only insistence was that his son would initiate him, and in the same way, Acarya Harprasadji initiated his son.

They belong to Krishnanagar. He is an advanced sadhaka, of good and handsome build and fair complexion and a pleasing
personality. From the time Baba came to Krishnanagar up to the time of his departure,
Harprasadji remained abnormal. DMC at Krishnanagar was possible due to his efforts.
His good efforts deserve all congratulations.



Krishnanagar is a beautiful city situated on the banks of the river Padma. The
specialty of this place is beautiful idols of various sizes of artistic designs and many
types of tasty sweetmeats. The next day most of the brother Margiis took their bath in
the Padma River and from there went to the place of residence of Baba. 

There underneath a blue sky on the velvet type of green lawns we performed our collective
meditation. Normally meditation should not be performed without an asan, even so that
day everyone had such experience during meditation that day through Baba’s grace that they will remain fresh in memory for lifelong. Someone was absolutely peaceful in the lotus posture- was shivering in vibrations like a peepal tree leaf. Other were making ‘humkar’ sound and some were crying aloud.

Later on we had Baba's darshan and returned to our various places of stay and by nine in the morning began to assemble in the same hall where DMC was held yesterday. 

Rev. Baba was to come here for general darshan. Now most of those present were Margiis only. One group of devotees began to dance before Baba’s arrival. 

They became so overwhelmed in devotional vibrations that they lost bodily
consciousness and continued to dance even after the arrival of Baba. Thereafter Baba’s speech began.

After finishing His talk Baba said, “Navadweep which is the birth place of the great Lord Caetanya is very near this place. You may like to go and see that place.”

After this some people went to Navadweep. Others began to see other neighboring places of Krishnanagar. Those who were left began to rotate around Baba’s residence, so that they may have another glimpse of him and may, perchance, get an opportunity to talk to Him. I was one of these who remained at Baba’s residence.

Here a small illustration is given of how much care Baba takes of the smallest
desires of his devotees. These who had remained at Baba’s residence before lunch
with a view t have his darshan, got their wishes fulfilled as Baba came out to meet
them. When he saw myself and some other Margiis there, he was gracious enough to
take his seat on my bedding and began to preach these around there. After sometime
he returned to his residence form there. Everyone felt overwhelmed with his grace that
day.

That evening Baba was going to address a Renaissance Universal meeting again, therefore we talk our seats in the hall well in advance. Baba arrived, was welcomed with garlands and welcome song and then he began his discourse.
All the three talks of Baba at Krishnanagar were in Bengali, but the language
was so simple and sweet and beautiful that these who were speaking different
language had no difficulty in following his speech very easily.

The third day after taking his breakfast Baba was to return to Calcutta. We also, therefore, planned to return via Calcutta. On our way we met several Margiis of Muzaffarpur under the leadership of Acarya Sakaldeoji who was also proceeding to Calcutta by the same train.

In Calcutta we stayed in a sarai and that day went to the residence where Baba
was staying with his younger brother who was serving as an officer in the engineeringdepartment of the railway. We reached somewhat late and Baba had already left his walk.

As Sakaldeoji knew which direction Baba used to go for a walk. We started in the same direction with him. As we proceeded, we saw Baba returning from his walk. 

We were somewhat surprised that Baba had returned for his walk son soon, but soon we realized that that Baba being all knowing, must have known that we had reached his place of residence, and son that we may not be disheartened, he cut short his walk and returned thus saving us unnecessary wanderings an unnecessary wanderings an unacquainted roads of this metropolitan city. We returned with Baba to his residence.

There we sat in the lawn to listen to his teachings. Afterwards we returned to the sarai with Baba’s permission.

Although it is always painful to part company with Baba we had taken
permission to return to Hajipur and Muzaffarpur. Thus on the fourth day by the
afternoon train we started for Hajipur. By the same train Ac. Sakaldeoji was also
returning to Muzaffarpur along with Margiis of that place.

This was my first experience of travelling with Ac. Sakaldeoji and his friends. It was extremely pleasant and invigorating. In the moving train he would continue telling stories about Baba and when the train would half at any station, he would buy eatables of different tastes including sweets and salty things and eat and offer others to eat
them. Thus the journey was extremely entertaining. We were included in the group of
devotees who where with him.

A blind beggar came to beg in the train. He had a small tinkling plate in one hand and in the other his stick to find the way with its help. Now he began to play on his improvised musical instrument and sing sweet moving songs of Surdas. He had
appeal and harmony mixed with his songs. 

He was singing with great devotion and abandon and sometimes added a foot sound to his music and songs. He charmed us
all with his voice and music. Acarya Sakaldeoji and Acarya Deep Narainji were particularly enchanted with his meaningful and moving songs and persuaded him to continue to sing till all his songs have been sung. He was assured adequate payment.

He repeated some beautiful songs of Surdas. The beggar was also enjoying the company of such an appreciative audience.

The environment was already full of devotion with references in events with Baba in the lives of various sadhakas. Now the songs of this Surdas added depth of devotion to the atmosphere. In the end he was paid adequately and seen off. Thus
floating in devotion we reached our respective hubs.

The specialty of this DMC was that right from a child up to the lowest of people enjoyed the devotional wave to the full. Now I have no right to claim Baba’s booms. Still it is my earnest request that he may shower such devotion at all. There is one more request from the Universal Protector Baba, that He may live in the hearts of His devotees in the mood and posture which was His during this DMC. 

On return from Krishnanagar we devoted I ourselves in our mission work with full enthusiasm. We also began to do pracar in a planned manner.

The philosophy of Ananda Marga given by Baba began to attach new devotees.

But with the growth of the Marga, obstacles also began to arrive in the individual and collective life. It was only with the support of madhu vidya taught by Baba that we could overcome them. We used to offer all our difficulties at his lotus feet.So despite the difficulties, progress continued. 

Sometimes a sense of hopelessness and dullness would arise when we faced difficulties at every step, but at
such times we would recall the verse of the Giita where Lord Krishna tells his devotee
Arjuna:

“It is very difficult to cross the ocean of Maya (illusion), but the who remembers Me constantly is able to overcome it. This illusionary power of Mine is full of attributes and is difficult to overcome. But these who reside in me are
able to cross this illusion with my help”.

Then we would again start work with redoubled energy, as we would recall the spirit of the above couplet.
Thus the year 1958 ended with Baba’s Grace.
