The first and second of January 1955 were holidays. I, therefore, did not go to the office, nor have a chance to read my mail. On the third of January, when I went to the office, a big bunch of letters awaited my attention. One of the postcards was from a brother disciple.

This was written in Jamalpur. There was another official letter in my name. First I read the postcard.

Shri Pranayji had written that Baba enquired about me on 1 of January 1955 at the ashram-quarter in Jamalpur. As I was not there Baba said amongst other disciples that Nagina stands first in 1954. He wanted this to be communicated to me through a
letter.

I was in a state of worry and fear and I tried to understand the significance of
this letter. Meanwhile I opened the official letter and found that it contained the order of
my demotion. Thus did bad news follow the good. I thought of God’s greatness and
how He had given me a mixture of pleasure and sorrow in one composite dose.

I gave the demotion order to my office and wrote on that letter itself to keep my charge report ready. There was quite a stir in the office when they saw this order. My subordinates felt sorry, some were happy also. My head clerk pointed out that this copy was personal and that it was not necessary to pass it on to the office.

Mostly such orders are not made public and people come to know the truth much later. I said, “what
is the use of hiding the truth for any time and how long can it be done? After all truth
will be out one day - then why not just now?” At this my head clerk passed the order on
to the office.

Shri Deep Narayanji was also in my department and his posting was under me.
He was also present in the office that day. He was overwhelmed with grief and
suggested that this order should be shown to Baba. I said that was of no use. Even so
he insisted made me write a letter to Baba to inform Him about this matter. He saw
Baba on fourth January and Baba replied to my letter in the following way:
Om

th
January 4 1955
Kalyaniyesu Nagina,
Just make an appeal to the competent authority.
The punishment imposed on and from December 26th should be
withdrawn without any further delay else I fear misfortunes will come one after
another.
Yours Ashirvadak
Anandamurti
I was very sad. Deep Narayanji brought to me this letter of Baba on the evening
of 4th January at Begusarai but I do not know why I was not very enthusiastic even afterreading Baba’s letter.
I said, “if according to destiny I must suffer pain and difficulties, then let them
pour in a stream. Let them come, I shall bear them. Now I shall not request for the
withdrawal of the punishment. Will the withdrawal of the punishment remove the
incoming difficulties? If not, what is the use?”
I thought, at worst, I shall be rendered a beggar or an invalid or I may face
humiliation. All right, let me have all these things, but I will not go to Jamalpur to Baba
for withdrawal of my punishment. As I said these words, Deep Narayanji began to
weep like a child and while weeping began to insist that I must go to Jamalpur. His
tears moved me and I was forced to go. He still insisted that I should go in the night
itself. A journey to Jamalpur in the night was very inconvenient so I wanted to go there
the next morning. But the insistence and the stream of tears of Deep Narayanji
compelled me to go to Jamalpur in the night itself.
Although my relation with Deep Narayanji was official and we are also disciple
brothers, but there was so much of love and affection in this weeping and his
insistence, which is rare even in ones own relations. I could not say no to his sincere
and loving insistence.
BABA WITHDRAWS MY PUNISHMENT AND BLESSES ME
th
I had Baba's Darshan on 5 January 1955 in the morning and I did my pranam
without touching Him.
Baba said, "You were given two punishments, first that you could not touch me
and secondly you could not participate in gurupuja. Now, one of them can be
withdrawn as per your choice."
So far I had not learnt gurupuja lesson. I, therefore, did not know how it was
done and what it was, so I requested for permission to touch Him. Baba hesitated and
asked, "So you want only the permission to touch." I replied in the affirmative.
I came to know later on that had I asked for gurupuja, it would have meant the
withdrawal of both the punishments simultaneously. But due to my ignorance about
gurupuja, I could not do so. When Baba permitted me to touch Him, I immediately
placed my head on His lotus feet and fell prostrate before Him in sastaung pranam. As
my head touched His feet, tears started incessantly pouring down from my eyes. Along
with the weeping I felt a sweet soothing sensation in my heart which was highly
pleasant. I remained there lying at His feet for a long time, washing them with my tears.
I got the punishment in the evening of 26th December 1954, and it was
th
withdrawn on the morning of 5 January 1955. Thus I was deprived from touching His
feet only for ten days, but when I did touch His feet, it appeared that I was getting this
chance not only after years, but many lifetimes. Even at other times a month would
sometimes elapse before I could come to Baba and thus there was no chance for this
time to touch His feet, but this gap of ten days appeared like ages.
I lay at His feet for quite some time. I was not willing to leave His feet. But when
Baba said, "Uttishtha" (get up), again and again, I got up and sat down at His feet.
Even after that the tears continued to flow. By now it was time for Baba to go, but He
continued to stay for my sake. I did not want to go, out with tears in my eyes. When
Baba asked me to leave, I said "Baba, I am weeping how can I go out. The world will
only understand that I was weeping because of my demotion, while they would not
know the truth, which is quite different”.Baba sat for some more time and I continued to sit with Him. When the flow of
tears subsided somewhat I came out and silently went to Bindeshwariji's residence
along with Deep Narayanji. My tears had stopped but the sweet sensation in the heart
continued almost for the whole day. I could not go to the office at Begusarai that day
and applied for a day’s casual leave.
That evening I also went to that house in the railway colony which had been
converted into an ashram. Deep Narayanji was also with me. As Baba was to come
here, we waited for Him. Baba came in the evening and every one present did
sastaunga pranam to Him.
That day Baba talked of philosophy and said that this school of philosophy will
be called ‘Ananda Marga'. He said, “The philosophy and the object of sadhana is
‘ananda’ or 'absolute bliss'. Therefore this has been named Ananda Marga”.
Then Baba said about the practice of Sahaj Yoga, "’Saha Jayate Iti Sahaj’, that
which is inborn, that which is natural or easy, is 'Sahaj Yoga'. To get bliss is the natural
aim of everyone that is why it is called ‘Ananda Marga’”. Baba stopped after saying
this.
I commented at this point, "Baba, though it is called ‘Sahaj Yoga’, that is, a
simple practice, but in effect Ananda Marga is a very difficult path”.
As I said this, Baba's body vibrated somewhat and He immediately went into
samadhi and we began to look after Him. When Baba came back to normal, He
returned to His residence.
th
Thus for the first time the name ‘Ananda Marga’ was announced on 5 January
1955 in the evening. He may have given this name before but the announcement came
on that day. That day it was also declared that there would be a Dharma Maha Cakra
on January 9

On sixth of January 1955 I returned to Begusarai. In the afternoon a gentleman,
who had been my subordinate earlier, came to take charge of my post. I was ready to
hand over, but he considered that as inauspicious somehow. So he wanted to defer the
th
matter. He took over charge from me on 7 January.
DMC IN JAMALPUR JANUARY 1955
th
On the 9 of January, the day of the Dharma Maha Cakra, I reached Jamalpur
along with my wife. That day for the first time I learnt gurupuja, its method and its
mantra in the ashram. That day I also saw some notices hanged on the wall, like
"smoking prohibited." I told the manager of the Ashram that he was put up this only
after making me a martyr. Had it been done earlier, I would have been saved from the
punishment. On another plate the following was written, ‘Shive Rusta Gurustrata - Guro
Rushto in Kashtana’, that is, ‘If God is angry, Guru will protect, but if Guru is angry,
there is no one to protect’. After reading this I mentally bowed before Baba.
th
When we were alone the manager of the ashram told me that on the evening of
5 January it was time for Baba to give up His body, but He had skipped over this
period by going into samadhi. I had been feeling sad that I had interrupted Baba! He
had been explaining the philosophy of Ananda Marga and I said that it was not so easya path as its name indicated. It was after I had said this that Baba had immediately
gone into samadhi.
In the evening Baba came to the ashram and sat in the room. There we did
guru puja in small groups. As we were finishing gurupuja, Baba gave me much
affection. Baba's affection was so wonderful. I felt that even if a hundred loving mothers
were to assemble and pour their affection simultaneously on a child, even that affection
would remain inferior to what Baba gave me. These are His ways of love.
After gurupuja, Baba sat on a platform in the inner verandah and the disciples
sat in the courtyard. In that DMC, the subject of Baba's discourse was 'The Prakrti
Tattva and Omkar Tattva' (The Creative Principle and the Primordial Sound). Baba's
discourse was clear and sweet, understandable and full of subtle meaning. Everyone
was listening intently to Baba's talk. At the time of DMC Baba looked very divine and
attractive. One did not like to miss the sight of His great personality for even a moment.
After the discourse was over Baba gave a demonstration of Omkar Tattva and said
'Everyone will hear this sound according to the stage of their sadhana. We all sat
attentively and later on checked from each other and found that everyone had heard
the sound in some form or the other.
After the discourse and the demonstration Baba blessed the gathering: “Those
who are present in this Dharma Maha Cakra either in physical body or subtle body will
not be required to be born again”. All of us were overjoyed to hear this blessing and
began to cry, "Baba Ki Jai".
th
Everyone was in ecstasy. After the DMC there was a collective meal. On the
10 of January I returned to Begusarai along with my wife.
I TAKE EXTENDED LEAVE AND RETURN TO JAMALPUR
Now it was no use for me to stay at Begusarai. I did not like my new posting. I
therefore decided to go on long leave. On giving some thought as to where I should
stay during my leave, first the idea came that I should go to my native village along with
my family, but this idea did not click. I did not want to go far from Baba. Again and
again my mind was being drawn to, His feet. I would become sad at even the thought
of being at a distance away from Him. My mind was like that proverbial bird on a ship
which after all its flights in the sky again and again returns to the ship itself. Jamalpur
and Baba had such attraction for me that my mind refused to rest anywhere else. I
remember these famous lines of the great poet Surdas in this context:
‘Mero man aat kaham sukh pave jaise uri jahaj ko panchhi
puni jahaj pai ave’. (‘The condition of my mind is just like a bird
in the ocean. The bird has no alternative but to come again and
again to the ship’).
Finally I decided to spend the period of my leave in Jamalpur at the feet of Rev.
Baba. Thus decided, the very next day along with my family and bag and baggage I
sent them to the village home, and myself came back to Jamalpur. I sent for leave for a
couple of months and began to stay with Bindeshwariji.
After a day or two I requested Baba for permission to go to His residence every
evening, do pranam to Him and go for a walk with Him. At this Baba said 'You will be
put in trouble and I shall be moved with pity.' I said 'This will be a big fortunate thing for
me, where is the question of trouble? And as long as I am in Jamalpur I shall not come
to you requesting for pity. I just want to be with you - otherwise what attraction hasJamalpur for to.' Baba kindly acceded to my request. Now every evening I started
going to His residence and after Pranam would go for a walk with Him. Thus every day,
about three hours I had the good fortune to be with Baba.
One day while sitting alone in Jamalpur, as I was ruminating on the sequence of
events, I realised that in September Baba had said that I would not be demoted unless
I willed it though He had tried to persuade me otherwise and accept the flow of events
in my stride. But at that time I was adamant that I should not face demotion. In the end
Baba had granted that I would get demotion only when I wanted it, and I was also
happy at this.
I REALISE THAT ALL HAS BEEN DONE BY BABA’S WILL
Time passed and I had almost forgotten that I had the boon of getting demoted
th
only when I willed it. Then after so many days on 25 December '54, Baba became so
angry on account of my smoking inside the ashram at Jamalpur. He was so angry that
day that He even did not like to accept my pranam.
That evening when I returned from Baba and was sitting lonely and depressed
mentally offering all my near and dear things to His one by one and insisting that He
may accept all of them and give me back His kind smile. After offering all these things I
also offered my post and position in the end of the chain of these offerings. As I
finished this mental offering, Bindeshwariji’s elder brother had entered the room and
enquired about the time. I had looked at my watch and informed him that it was five in
the evening. I, therefore, recalled quite clearly that the last offering was made at 5 p.m.
That day Baba's evening darshan was in the quarter. While returning from the quarter I
asked Baba what had I done to incur His displeasure? And Baba replied 'I am not
displeased with you since 5 p.m. At that time in the house I was not normal. Thereafter
on the evening of the 26th December 1954, I was given the punishment of which I have
already written.
As far as I came to know later, my reversion order started from Delhi on the 27th
December 1954. It was issued from Patna on the 31st December 1954 and I received it
at Begusarai on the 3rd January 1955. The government had decided to demote me in
September 1954 and it was recorded on the file also. But Baba had said after this
decision of the government that I would get demotion at my will and hence the gap.
Where this order was lying from September up to December end, Baba alone knows. I
got it only when mentally I had offered my post and position to Him.
Now the question arises, did I indeed decide this of my own free will? This
question is difficult to answer. Perhaps circumstances so conspired that I had to will my
own demotion. Here I recollect the following line of poet Vidyapati, "It is my misfortune,
no-one else is at fault". I find this is applicable here. I got a new realisation that Baba is
equally the softest and the hardest at the same time. Anyway this gave me an
opportunity to be close to Him.
