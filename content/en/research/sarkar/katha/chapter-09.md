In the winter of 1954 I began to have difficulty whenever I would sit in sadhana.

I felt a block when I reached a certain point in my meditation. This continued for many days. Although the stage I had reached was enjoyable, I was dissatisfied as my progress now felt blocked. There was no opportunity to take leave from my office so that I could see Baba and ask Him about it.

In the meantime, I continued my meditation and in some frustration and pain I sat for sadhana as usual. One evening, when I reached the very same stage during my meditation, I felt that someone moved my mind ahead with a small sweet push and my
mental state became very pleasant. 

Now the blockage was removed, I became more deeply engrossed in meditation.
After some days, I got leave and went for Baba's darshan. At His residence, I
sat near Baba after doing pranam.
Baba said, "What was the need to come now? Your work is already done." I did
not follow.
Baba again said "Now your meditation is good, isn't it?"
I replied in the affirmative and then realised why Baba said that now there was
no need for me to come here.
I asked Baba, “Is it possible that You can know the needs of Your disciples
whilst sitting here and can fulfil them from here?”
Baba smiled a little at the naiveté of my question and said, "You are in
government service and it may be that the government will send you to America or
England. Do you think that you will not get my guidance there when you need it?
America and England are not like Begusarai that you can rush to me and ask me any
question you may have!”
I asked, “Baba what would happen in that situation?”
Baba said, "All guidance will be available."
And after that Baba began to explain the whole theory to me scientifically. For a
beginner like myself in the world of sadhana, these things seemed amazing. But when I
saw these things happening to me, wonder was converted into belief. It was the great
grace of Baba that He was strengthening my faith. To remove my doubts Baba gave
me the experience of His omniscience again and again. How kind and compassionate
He is!
THE LIBERATION OF ‘VAJRA BHAIRAV’
One evening Baba was sitting on the tiger’s grave with a young brother disciple
and myself.Baba commented, “Formerly when the number of devotees was less when I
was alone on this grave in the evenings, I used to expand my mind to see who is doing
what. But I am no more alone now and therefore do not do that anymore.
One evening while my mind expanded I saw a person standing in western dress
before me. When I asked about his identity, he said his name was Shyam Charan
Lahiri, (the revered guru of Yogananda Paramahansa’s guru Shri Yukteshwar,
otherwise known as Lahiri Mahashaya), and that he belonged to Nadia District1 in
Bengal. Very humbly he pressed me for his final liberation (moksa).
I told him, ‘It is not possible to get enlightenment without doing sadhana and
sadhana is not possible without having a human body’. Even then he continued to
supplicate and press me for his salvation.”
Puzzled, I asked Baba, “Just now You told me that he was a person from
Bengal and in western dress, then how does the question of having a human body
arise? He was very much in human form when he was talking to You!”
Baba explained, “He was a bodiless soul. He died long ago. When I expanded
my mind, that bodiless soul took the support of my ectoplasm (citta) and stood up
2
before me. The clothes were those he had worn during his life . Taking the support of
my ectoplasm he came in that very dress before me.
Even though I explained to him again and again that unless he had a human
body it would be very difficult to give him the help he wanted, he continued to press me
most humbly and earnestly. Seeing his sincerity I took pity on him. I gave him a place
for sadhana beside the tree that stands near this grave.” Baba indicated the banyan
3
tree that stands no more than five yards west of the Englishman’s grave and thirty-five
yards from the tiger’s grave. The young disciple brother and I both looked at it in awe
as if we had not seen it before.
“Since then, whenever I am alone on this grave, I give the support of my citta
dhatu and bring him in human form. He sits there in front of me and I guide him in
sadhana. His sadhana has progessed very rapidly.
Baba then told us the entire story of Shyam Charan Lahiri’s initiation near
Ranikhet in the forest of the Himalayas. The same story, with some variations, is told
by Swami Yogananda in his ‘Autobiography of a Yogi’, and by Swai Satyeshvarananda
in his ‘ Lahiri Mahasay, the Father of Kriya Yoga’. After hearing this story from Baba, I
obtained a copy of Yogananda’s autobiography and read it.
Baba continued, “I have named him Vajra Bhairav. His body is very frightening
to look at, but he is actually very kind and compassionate. He loves his brother
disciples very much. Nagina someday I shall introduce Vajra Bhairav to you”.
1
Naginada has on different occasions mentioned different places as that given by Shyam Charan Lahiri as
his home district. As it seems that his memory had perhaps faltered on this point, the correct place has
been given here. Ed.
2
Again, an amendment has been made here. Naginada had originally mentioned Baba as saying that the
clothes were those in which Shyam Charan Lahiri had died, which is unlikely, though as a government
servant, he did indeed wear western dress during his entire working life. Ed.
3
Naginada had also recollected Baba saying the nearby mango-tree was the site of Vajra Bhairav’s
sadhana. Ed.By then my young brother disciple who was also with me could not curb his
curiosity and began to insist that he would also like to meet Vajra Bhairav and then
Baba stopped speaking. After sometime he started another subject.
After many days, I asked Baba about Vajra Bhairav.
“His sadhana is complete” answered Baba, “and he has merged with the
Supreme.”
Vajra Bhairav had left the world of form and gone on to absolute formlessness.
There would never be a chance to meet him.
It has been my experience from the beginning, that when Baba is speaking
about some subject the best thing is to go on listening silently. Baba then covers all
aspects Himself and if necessary gives demonstrations also. But a show of untimely or
unwanted curiosity can interrupt the flow and things are spoiled, as happened this time.
From time to time, Baba says things that mean one thing to us at the time, but
we only understand it deeper significance much later. Really speaking Baba always
speaks in the form of sutras or highly concise language, and we must ponder the
hidden meanings.
THE ‘OUTSIDE’ DISCIPLES
Sometimes whilst on field walk with Baba we used to hear and see some very
interesting things. I sometimes saw a man with a shawl wrapped around his body and
arms awaiting Baba in the darkness of the bushes. Another strange man with a shawl
around him, would suddenly do pranam with folded hands to Baba, keeping his back
towards us. Baba used to move forward with a minimum acknowledgment to these
phenomena. Once I gathered the courage and asked Baba about these people. Baba
only replied that I should not inquire about these matters. I was curious, because I had
never seen any of His disciples act or behave in this way. Sometimes Baba used to
send me back once we had reached the field, saying that some people from "outside"
had an appointment with Him.
Once I went all the way to the field and asked Baba, "Baba who are these
people that take away our time with You in the field? They rob us of our treasured
time."
Baba replied, "These people are coming from very, very far distances. They are
greatly disappointed if I don't give them some time. This is why I have to ask you to
return."
I asked, "Are they also our disciple brothers?"
Baba replied, "There are many types of people. Some of them are your brother
disciples, but they are not in Ananda Marga. I have not permitted them yet. Some of
them are not your disciple brothers, but they come once a year with their body for my
darshan. Some of them are my disciples from my previous life. Many of them have
reached perfection. They see me in their meditation and know that I am here and then
come for my darshan."
After we had gone a little way, Baba described an incident about His disciples
of His previous life. Baba said, "Once I was passing by the Kali temple in Calcutta.
Suddenly I saw two sadhus in front of the temple on the street. One of them wasshouting and gathering people to tell them their fortune. The other sadhu was reading
people's palms. I went up to him and asked him if he could read my hand also. He told
me that I would have to wait for my turn, as many people were ahead of me. I told him
that I had to meet somebody, but firmly told him to wait for me until I returned. He
agreed. After sometime, the sadhu who was gathering people whispered something to
the other sadhu. Soon both of them collected their things and ran away from there.
When I returned they were gone, so I asked by-standers about them. They said that
soon after I had departed, those sadhus discussed something with each other, and
then appeared very scared and finally ran away."
I asked, "Baba, who were those sadhus?"
He said, "They were my disciples from my previous life. They had reached a
very high stage of spirituality. When I forcefully commanded them to wait until I
returned, they wondered about me. So they concentrated their minds in meditation to
see who I was. Then they realized that I was their previous guru. Just as I demand
strict following of the principles of Yama and Niyama from you people, I also demanded
it from them. To earn money by reading palms is against Yama and Niyama, so they
quickly escaped."
I asked, "If they had reached such a high stage, then why did they do that?"
Baba replied, "They were actually travelling from Assam to Punjab. They did not
have sufficient money for the train fare, so they decided to make some money in
Calcutta. Although they were not greedy, and wanted to earn just enough for the train
fare, their act was against Yama and Niyama, and so they became frightened of me
and ran away."
That day Baba continued His mystical Lila even more. He said, "Last time when
I sent you back from the field, a siddha (realized soul) had come for my darshan from
Barahland. He comes annually for my darshan."
I asked, "Baba, is he my disciple brother?" Baba said, "No."
I asked, "Why does he come for your darshan, if you are not his guru?" Baba
replied, "When a siddha, with the power of his meditation, sees that the Taraka Brahma
is already present on the planet, he comes for His darshan."
After some days a brother disciple and I were going on a field walk with Baba.
We saw a man sitting near the fence of a house on the right-hand side of the
intersection near the railway colony quarters.
As we passed by, he stood up, stretched himself and rather loudly said, "Hari,
Hari. My back hurts, having sat here for such a long time."
Hearing "Hari, Hari", Baba started and looked at him, but then kept on walking
normally.
Suddenly I thought, "Oh gosh, I hope Baba won't send me back today also!”
Immediately Baba started laughing and said, "Nagina, how will you feel if I send
you back from the field today?"
I said, "No Baba, I won't go back today. So many times we reach the field and
You send me back. I do not want to go back today."Now Baba told the other disciple to stay ten steps behind us and said to me,
"That gentleman did pranam to me in a coded manner by using my iista mantra. He is
a siddha, and has come, walking all the way from Barahland, just to meet me. If I do
not give him some time, he will be very unhappy. You go back now."
That man's clothing was quite filthy and repulsive, like the clothes of a madman.
He had put on an undershirt and a plaid shorts. Greatly disappointed, I started back
with my brother disciple. Before we reached the intersection, I told that brother disciple
that we would find that man near the intersection. There were two roads from the
intersection, I took the left and the disciple brother took the road on the right. We
hurried a lot but failed to find him. We could not understand how he could have eluded
us, even though we searched both the roads.
The next day Baba quenched my curiosity somewhat. He said, "Nagina, that
gentleman wishes to give up his body now. He had come just to ask my permission for
that, and I have given it to him."
I asked, "If you are not his guru, then why did he come to You for the
permission to give up his body?"
Baba said, "There is a proper discipline to be followed in the spiritual world also,
and that is why he came to me. His guru has already given up his body, and in his
absence, he came to me. I first told him to keep his body for some time to serve
humanity. But he insisted on giving up his body, so I finally gave him permission."
It was incredible! Countless great and realized souls and siddhas used to come
to Him, in so many disguises for His grace, consultation, darshan or permission for
something that only they knew! We simply witnessed these unusual phenomena! My
faith and devotion for Baba increased a lot, after hearing these stories from Baba.
BABA’S PREVIOUS DISCIPLES
One afternoon of a public holiday I went to Baba’s residence in Keshavapur. I
found two sadhus in loincloths with matted hair and sandal paste marks on their bodies
were sleeping on the open ground in front of the house adjoining Baba’s residence.
At this sight it occurred to me that if these fellows were to have lain in this
attitude of surrender before Baba’s residence, their purpose in life would perhaps have
been fulfilled, but I could not see any reason for their lying outside a neighbouring
residence. Then the idea came to my mind that after all every thing depends on Baba’s
will. Maybe Baba has desired that they should rest in front of the neighbouring house
so that the visitors to his house are not disturbed. Then I thought that some of Baba’s
disciples of his previous life have appeared as sadhus such as these. Are these two of
them also?
While I was pondering these questions, Baba’s gate was opened, and after
doing my pranam, I sat in His sitting-room for His pravarchan. When I left, the two
sadhus were still lying there but had gone when I returned in the evening as uisual.
Now my curiosity about them was awakened. I accompanied Baba on His walk
and enquired about those two mendicants from Him but Baba remained silent. This
was the first time that Baba did not reply to my query. But even his silence was for my
welfare, which I did not immediately realise.
After walking a little further Baba started talking on various subjects, and during
this discussion, Baba said, “Each and every sadhaka of Ananda Marga is like a flameof fire. If someone attempts to touch it with malicious intent, they are bound to get
burnt. I cannot tolerate anyone harming my disciples, and I cannot remain a silent
spectator if this happens. Nagina, I have struggled and in every walk of life struggle is a
must. Peace is the result of this fight. Peace cannot be attained by crying, ‘Peace!
Peace!’”
That day in the field, Baba continued to talk about life and struggle. He said,
“People must struggle to maintain their existence. This struggle is both internal as well
as external.”
As I prepared for bed on returning from the field that day, I again remembered
those two sadhus and began to think of them. Then I recollected that Baba had
instructed His disciples of His previous life to remain undiscovered, so for this reason
they would have been unable to tell me who they really were. This was the reason
Baba also chose to keep quiet when I asked about them. All such disciples of Baba
who have reached the end of their sadhana come once a year to have His darshan in
body.
When I thought of these things, I felt sad thinking that I had not met them and
talked with them as my own brothers. Baba’s silence was proper in every way - it was
useless to regret it now. But I consoled myself with the thought that Baba must have
wanted this to happen in this manner. Still the thought that I should have met them
continues to haunt my mind. An opportunity like this did not come again in my life.
THE LADY IN WHITE
In October 1954, I had a peculiar experience during sadhana. Whenever I
practiced dhyana, I would see the image of a lady clad in white emanating strong
spiritual vibrations. This continued for many days. After some days I got an opportunity
to go with Baba for His field walk, and I mentioned this experience.
Baba stopped walking and said, "You have been taught to meditate on the guru
and not on the consort of the guru", and then He was silent.
Astonished, I asked Baba whether He had got married, as He was making this
reference to the wife of the Guru?
Baba said, "There is a lady who has taken the vow that she will only marry me
or she will not marry at all. That girl is a good aspirant and has reached the stage of
nirvikalpa (unqualified) samadhi. She appears in the meditation of those disciples
whose practice is good".
I enquired whether she was also a sister disciple, and Baba said she was not.
After mentioning this phenomena to Baba, I never saw that holy white clad lady again
during my meditation.
Baba was always encouraging virtuous family life emphasising its importance
and superiority. We disciples would sometimes discuss amongst ourselves that Baba is
leading a single life Himself and encouraging others to become householders. I used to
say, “Baba will get married and lead a family life”, but others considered this
impossible. However in due course Baba did indeed get married.
Salutations to Baba who is Tenderer than Tenderness itselfTHE POWER OF IISTA MANTRA
Baba gave us some realisation about the power of the practice of iista mantra
sometime toward the end of the winter of 1953.
"One who is established in the practice of iista mantra will not be subject to
accidental death. He will die when he desires”
Baba had said this about the efficacy of iista mantra and He was kind enough to
make us realise its truth during the summer of 1955 in Jamalpur where I witnessed the
following incident.
One of my departmental colleagues was an Inspector at Monghyr. His wife had
a serious miscarriage and was admitted in the district hospital there. Her condition
deteriorated and became so serious that the doctors lost all hope. Both she and her
husband had been initiated by Baba himself.
My colleague came to me in feeling utterly desperate and told me about this
wife's condition and the opinion of the doctors. He had left her to the care of doctors in
the hospital and come to Jamalpur to ask me to request and press Baba to save his
wife. Seeing him so grief-stricken and at his wit’s end, I went to Baba and told Him
about the situation.
Baba said in a somewhat an irritated tone, "He will not do sadhana, and when
he finds himself in a desperate situation, he approaches me."
I said, "Baba, where else can he go?" Baba remained silent.
I again requested Baba, “Do something to enable her to get better this time. In
future let them reap the fruits of their actions." Baba still remained silent.
I could see my colleague's sad face in my mind and so I repeatedly asked Baba
to be pleased and specially grace the lady who was on her deathbed.
At last Baba graciously replied, “Tell him to go to the hospital immediately and
whisper to his wife that she should continue the repetition of iista mantra no matter how
ill she becomes. In her condition the japa (repetition) of iista mantra alone can save
her. The doctors’ treatment should continue and at the same time, she should also go
on repeating her iista mantra. This will cure her."
I bowed my head at Baba’s feet and returned to tell my colleague about the
directions, indications and blessings of Baba. He rushed back to the hospital and did as
was directed by Baba. After three days his wife recovered and he met me again and
said, “All the doctors wondered how my wife recovered. The doctors were of the
opinion that but for the special grace of the Almighty, it was impossible to save my wife
from certain death”.
Baba's 'Ananda Lilla' (blissful play of life), is beyond the reach of human mind.
When and where He will make us realise the truth of his instructions and teaching we
can not imagine, He alone knows. By the grace of Baba, this experience strengthened
my faith immensely in the practice of iista mantra.THE PRACTICE OF MANTRA
In my early days as a disciple, I often felt unsure of myself because of my
inexperience and sometimes doubted my judgement about how to do the practices
correctly.
In April of 1954, I was bothered by a somewhat embarrassing question. Before
and while going to the toilet, I did not use or practice either guru mantra or iista mantra.
There was the feeling in my mind as to how I could invoke guru mantra or repeat iista
mantra for such a dirty place and occasion while I was in the toilet.
One day, without my ever having mentioned my dilemma, Baba enquired, “Why
don't you take guru mantra before going to the toilet and iista mantra while you are in
the toilet? “
I already had negative ideas on the subject, so I said, “Baba, these mantras are
such pure and high and great thing, how can I use them in that dirty place?”
I said this so spontaneously and simply that Baba’s mood became light, He
gave me a smile and said, “Nagina, this is an expression of the feeling of hatred.
Hatred is a bondage. This has also to be overcome, and how can you overcome it
without the help of guru mantra and iista mantra? Wherever there is pressure of such
feelings like hatred etc. there the use of guru mantra is all the more necessary. When
the whole of this creation is in Parama Purusa how you will hate this thing or that?”
These words of Baba opened up my inner eyes, and since then I started using
guru mantra and iista mantra on these occasions also.
DO PRANAM WITHOUT DESIRE
One day, I was sitting at Baba’s feet with a few other brother disciples and Baba
said, “A disciple should always bow to the guru with a vacant mind. The guru knows
everything about who requires what and when."
I had in fact been doing my sastaunga pranam at Baba's lotus feet with a
vacant mind, and that this was correct was confirmed by Baba that day. Even so I
began to think whether Baba had been directing this admonition specifically towards
me and whether there was some trace of a desire in my mind at the time of doing
pranam. But I could not recall anything.
Later on I came to know that Shri Lalanji had a special desire and prayed in his
mind for the fulfillment of that desire as he did sastaunga pranam. However, since the
time I heard these words from Baba, my mind automatically feels completely empty
and surrendered when doing pranam to Him.
Salutations to Baba who is the Great Lord of all the Lords!
KUMUD GETS AN EXTENSION OF LIFE
On the evening of the first Saturday of November 1954, I went to Jamalpur for
Baba’s darshan. After darshan and doing my sastaunga pranam Baba blessed me and
I accompanied Him on His walk.I stayed that night at Bindeshwariji’s place and in the morning at about 9 o’clock
we were relaxing in the courtyard. We looked up and to our astonishment saw Baba
entering the compound. Our surprise and happiness knew no bounds, and as Baba
came a few steps inside, I rushed barefoot and did my pranam by touching His feet. I
had hardly got up when Bindeshwariji also came running and bowed and touched His
feet.
Observing us, Kumud, Bindeshwariji’s eldest daughter ran to Baba and placed
her head on His feet. At that time she was about eight but she had not been initiated.
We asked Baba to please bless the house by coming into the sitting room for
some time. But Baba stood outside and replied, “No, I was coming in this direction and
thought that I should tell you that I will not be able to come to the railway quarter today.
You can meet me at my house at about four in the afternoon. I also wanted to see
Bindeshwariji’s house, so I dropped by”.
Bindeshwariji again requested Baba to kindly enter and bless his house, but
Baba replied, “Some other day” and began to leave.
We went up to the road to see Baba off and Baba was kind enough to inquire
about the little girl who had also done her pranam along with us. I told Him that she
was Bindeshwariji’s eldest daughter. Baba told Bindeshwariji to get her initiated quickly
as the girl had a short life. We again touched Baba’s feet and He blessed us and left for
His home.
In the afternoon, my mentor Shrii Chandranathji and two other senior brother
disciples came there. We exchanged greetings and I enquired about their welfare. Shrii
Chandranathji said, "These people want to ask you something. Kindly answer them.
They have brought me along as they do not know you well”.
I said, “I do not think that I know anything of value to them, But as it is your
request, I shall endeavour to reply their questions to the best of my ability.
They asked, "What is your mode of propagation of the ideal that so many
people are inspired to take initiation? You come once a week and hand over a list to
Baba and His mornings and evenings are completely booked for the next week. We
also try, but none gets ready and even if someone gets ready, Baba says, ‘There is no
time. Nagina has got the whole week booked already’. This has been happening for
many weeks. As a result, one or two whom we prepare for initiation lose interest due to
delay in fixing their time".
What could I reply to such questions as these? I said, “Only Chandranathji can
reply satisfactorily to these questions. I put Baba's ideals before people in the same
way he brought me to Baba's shelter. I always remember Baba while speaking about
His ideals. Those who like these ideals insist on taking initiation and I put their names
before Baba. I follow Baba’s instructions and never say anything about Him directly -
and as far as I understand Baba himself spreads His ideals, we are only His mediums."
They then enquired from Chandranathji about how to convince others.
Chandranathji passed the ball back to me and said, “In the true sense, he (meaning
myself) also is my means of propagation of the ideal. Now he is crediting me for his
efforts, but still he is doing most of the work”.
This was a kind gesture of Chandranathji and these senior brothers, that they
came to ask me about my mode of pracar. Really speaking, I was always eager to
learn it from them. I was always the least disciplined, worthless disciple. I was like amischievous student who always prefers to sit on the last seat of the last row in the
class ! Chandranathji always encouraged me by bringing me to the front.
At four in the afternoon we went to Baba’s house and had His darshan and did
pranam to Him. He talked to us for some time and then said to me “If you are not
returning to Begusarai, you can accompany me for field walk in the evening”. I felt very
happy to think that I again had an opportunity to spend some more time with Baba.
When we returned from seeing Baba I saw that Bindeshwariji was a little
worried. I enquiried and he said that he was thinking about his daughter, Kumud,
because in the morning Baba had talked about her short life. I consoled him, ”When we
go to see Baba today we shall raise this topic. You get an appointment with Baba for
her initiation. When Baba has been kind enough to warn you, He will surely also
suggest some remedy”.
Then I told Bindeshwariji how Baba had saved my daughter from the jaws of
death, and said, "Then why worry for her?”
At the usual time in the evening we again went to Baba’s residence and had His
darshan and did our sastaunga pranam. We then walked towards the field along with
Baba. After reaching the field Baba sat on the grave and asked us also to sit there. We
sat on both sides of Baba. There, Bindeshwariji requested for the initiation of his
daughter Kumud.
Baba said, “I shall spare some time and do it early. Why do you bother?” After
this we did not ask any further questions about her.
That evening we sat for about three hours and listened to His teachings. While
returning from the field when we came near the Jubilee Well, Baba asked us to return
home. Bindeshwariji's residence is very near the Jubilee Well. We again touched His
feet and returned to Bindeshwariji’s residence. Later on, Baba Himself went and
initiated Bindeshwariji’s daughter at his residence. That girl is fortunate enough to be
still alive and is happy today with her children and family. Great is Baba’s mercy and
grace, which are not dependent on any cause.
