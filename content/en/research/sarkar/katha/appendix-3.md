[Published in Prajina Bharati April 1984]

Respected Mr. Editor,

It is very nice that certain points of Ananda Katha have provoked interesting discussions. Ac. Hari Shankarji’s letter on Nagina da’s clarification has stirred thoughts in my humble psychic world and I wish to share them with others.

I can not say how far my words will satisfy the curiosity of inquisitive souls but I would
like to pen for critical appreciation the answer I find within me.

Since I am taking the liberty to express my views on a matter related to Nagina da’s writings, I offer my sincerest apology to him.

It is evident Naginada has reproduced Baba’s words in Ananda Katha. It is also clear
he didn’t feel it necessary to question Baba on the points that are agitating the mind of
some well-meaning devotees. In my view he didn’t do it since he didn’t find any reason
to disbelieve Baba and also because those matters didn’t appear incongruous to him.
The bone of contention is: whether Taraka Brahma has a previous life and if he doesn’t
have, how can Shri Ram Chandra Upadhyaya be deemed to be Baba in this life.
Needless to say Taraka Brahma has no previous life as he is unborn or self-born. What
about Shri Ram Chandra Upadhyaya episode then – is it untenable?

To me, it is not. In order to understand this riddle, a short philosophical discussion will
be of great help.

In idea and Ideology, it is said.... The non-uniformity of speed changes the movement
of the unit mind to an elliptical force, and the movement changes to oval from circular.
They get merged in Purusottama who aspired for Him as the ultimate destiny, but those
who aim at moksa where sadhana is the complete surrender of self into that (Nirguna
Brahma), get out of this Brahma Cakra by a tangential touch. At this point of tangential
touch is the abode of Taraka Brahma (who resides within the scope of both Nirguna
and Saguna Brahma)

This means it is a particular position and state of consciousness, which we call Taraka Brahma just as we call Nirguna and Saguna due to their distinctive state of consciousness. 

We can not say then that this entity has a separate existence from the supreme and that it holds a particular position independent of the supreme. Its has become supreme and as such is Supreme in its new status. Take for example water of
well, pond and ocean. After due purification when they are mixed together, no trace of
the distinctive characteristics of well, pond or ocean could be found. What we find is
just water. All distinctions have vanished since the factors creating distinctions exist no
more now.

Similarly a sadhaka in the elevated state of his mind passes through various
experiences, and merges in the highest being when he has exhausted all his
samskaras. In that supreme state of psychic dilation though we may address him by a
particular name, the fact however is that he has already cast off the robe of unit entity.
He can give up physical body whenever he desires. The bondage of mortal life ceases
for him in that most exalted state.It is true Taraka Brahma has no need for sadhana for His salvation. He is not in
bondage so there is no question of salvation for him. He is perfect within Himself. He is
the Supreme Lord, the goal of all creatures and objects. But then the moot point is:
when He takes a samkalpa to assume human form for the welfare of the world in the
most critical circumstances, how does it materialise? Sine he has no previous life, how
to get a physical medium for expression?

There can be no abrupt appearance of a physical structure for Taraka Brahma
Everything has to follow the law of creating and evolution. Else, what is the need at all
of being born from the womb of a woman? He can just materialize a fully-grown up
body, a well-developed human personality, to serve as his medium and start his work
all at once instead of associating himself with a family, with mother father, brother,
sisters etc. But it doesn’t happen like that as this will be the negation of the laws of
prakrti. 

It will be unnatural. What does he do then? He wants to take a human form and
assign a role for himself. At that moment he chooses a medium whose all samskaras
have been exhausted and therefore free from the qualification of unit entity. Obviously
this medium can be any unit who has reached that supreme state since all are same at
that pinnacled state of consciousness. And it is in this background, that a particular
body may be said to possess a particular name at a given time of its existence in the
evolutionary flow of cosmological order. The mind of an entity requires a physical frame
that is capable of maintaining parallelism with its psychic wave. And so Taraka Brahma
chooses a body inhabited by a liberated soul.
The mention of Shri Ram Chandra Upadhyaya in this regard is simply to denote that it
was the medium accepted by Taraka Brahma. It was Ram Chandra Upadhyaya who
got salvation and not the Taraka Brahma. And Taraka Brahma utilized the highly
evolved physical organism of Shri Upadhyaya for his physical expression. And thus no
communication gap appears to exist in relation to Shri Upadhyaya and his subsequent
lives. Somewhere Baba has said. “Body is not the guru. The entity operating within the
body is Guru... but the form has special significance since He is expressing through it.
Therefore use of the term ‘Baba’ by Nagina da in describing the previous lives is
merely to state the narrative. Quite obviously the body is presently the medium of
expression of Taraka Brahma, but since, in the evolutionary flow of the cosmos it is
related to Shri Upadhyaya Baba has been used in both the senses according to the
context.

Another relevant point to be mentioned here is that Taraka Brahma is an Infinite, formless. Abstract entity. How can he have a physical body, which is bound by the imperfection of limitations? It is therefore absurd to debate on the point that Taraka
Brahma created an altogether a different and special body which doesn’t have to pass
through saincara and pratisaincara. Such a proposition will be totally illogical and
philosophically unsound. And precisely for this reason the theory of avatarvada is not
supported b ‘Ananda Marga philosophy.

Taraka Brahma is an entity and not a body. He chooses a body for his expression which he deems best. The form is not He, resident of the form is He. 

In his discourse on Tantra and Indo-Aryan civilization (see the book Abhimata) Baba
has said: “the question as to who between Shiva Krsna is superior does not arise. All
Brahma-knowing entities are same. They are all Brahma.” By using the expression
Brahma – knowing entities” implication is that Brahma alone knows Brahma and one
realizing Brahma becomes Brahma himself. He is verily Brahma is that stance of his
existence.

While recording Baba’s words in the article, ”Unresolved Mystery” in Bodhikalpa (January 75), reverend brother (Late) Amitananda Avadhuta writes: “I have gone toJamalpur hill for doing sadhana. I am sitting at a particular place when someone tells in my ears, come with me.

I will show you a better place for sadhana follow me. I see no one but I follow the voice whose presence I feel so clearly and asks me to do sadhana after a while it tells me, Are you mad? 

Don’t he is Maya. Are you P.R. Sarkar? See who your are! And a reel of my past life, my earlier lives, flashes clearly before my eyes and I realize who I am” (Here “I” is used for Baba).

Once in a demonstration on an avadhuta at Jamalpur, Baba asked him to see who He (Baba) was 7000 years ago. The avadhuta saw Shiva. When asked to see 3500 years ago, he saw Krsna.

Taraka Brahma has no previous lives, but the fact that he was Shiva and Krsna is
previous lives is intended to suggest that Lord comes in every age on a particular
mission. The same Lord is known as Shiva, Krsna and today Anandamurti. He is the
same whenever and wherever He appears.

In the book Vicitra Abhijinata Baba has termed certain experiences as samskaraja i.e. born out of one’s innate samskaras, which results from the psychological peculiarities of the person. In such strong experiences one experiences the reflection has own self in a particular circumstance or at a particular time. 

It is thus natural that in Baba’s case it would be Shiva and Krsna as the reflections of his earlier lives.
Another question that tortures the mind as who is telling Baba “Are you P.R. Sarkar?
She what you are.” Meaning thereby he is not actually P.R> Sarkar?

To my humble and imperfect intellect at seems that because of psychic association of a unit mind with that physical body, the vibrational imprint of the unit in a very subtle and almost theoretical form remains with the structure and therefore the call to shake off this imprint.

In the end I would like to emphasize that Lord’s Liila is inscrutable. The more we try to
question and find out the answer, greater is the chance of being confused. Taraka
Brahma is not a figure of philosophy, He is the creation of devotional sentiment. Hence
total surrender can alone satisfy the inner urge of a soul.
It is due to this reason that when Amitanandaji requested Baba to untangle the riddle
about strange factual events concerning Him, Baba's reply was:

"Naham manye suvedeti no na vedeti veda ca.
Yo nastadveda tadveda no na vedeti veda ca".
That is, "Neither do I say that I know Him, nor do I say that I don’t know Him, because I
know He is beyond my knowing and not knowing.”

More we make attempt to understand the mysteries of his Liila, the more we lose
ourselves in Him. We can never completely grasp the depth and plurality of His sports,
his manifestations, by sheer intellectual analysis, howsoever brilliant and exhaustive it
might be, He alone knows the secret of his mysteries and those trying to unravel it
merge in him in the process.

May the Great Kind and Sweet Lord pardon this humble child again for speaking about
the unspeakable, for discussing the undebatable and for scrutinizing the inscrutable.
May the Compassionate One forgive this impertinence of this ignorant child.

Yours sincerely,
Santosananda Avadhuta
