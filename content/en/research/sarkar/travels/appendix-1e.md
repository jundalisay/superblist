Calcutta, 1989. 

Between 2 points of no magnitude there is a flow of cognition [aether]. In that fluidal flow of cognition, **bubbles are created**. 

**These bubbles are bubbles of ideas in the Cosmic emanation of the Supreme.** 

When these bubbles touch the unit I feeling, then unit ideas are created as a result of close proximity to the Cosmic Ocean. 

These are the  reflections or refractions of the Cosmic Idea. When these ideas concern the unit, the unit I tries to express them through its own psychophysical structure.

That endeavor to express its unit desires and longings according to the capacity of its vocal cords and its hormonal secretion of these reflected or refracted ideas is called 'language.' 

That expression within is called 'inner voice,' and that expression without is  called 'outer voice.' 

According to structural, environmental, climatic and racial differences, language is expressed in different forms. There we get different languages. In the expressed world, linguistic differences have a small value. But in the inner world they have no meaning or impact. 

As far as the reflected bubbles are concerned, the language of the universe is the same, was the same, and will remain the same forever. 

The language of  the inner voice is always one and indivisible.

Approximately every 2000 years there comes a major change in the script of any particular language or set of languages. Though exceptions are numerous, approximately every 1000 years the language itself undergoes major change. 

For example, Sanskrit evolved into 7 different people's languages, and those languages later evolved into some of our current languages. Similarly, Latin, Semitic and Vedic 
languages and scripts also evolved. 


### 8 Factors which Complete a Language

If any of these are absent, then it is not a full-fledged language: 

1. Vocabulary
2. Pronouns
3. Verb endings 
4. Case endings
5. Literature 
6. Intonation 
7. Psycho-acoustic notes (having psychological effect) 
8. Syntax


There is a close relationship between the racial factor and language. 

Where sub-races arose, language changed. There are 5 dominant ancient languages: 

1. Sanskrit
2. Vedic
3. Latin
4. old Hebrew
5. old Chinese. 

Max Mueller (the great philologist) believed that Sanskrit came from  the Aryans. In fact, it was the Vedic language which hailed from those areas. 

40% of the Russian and Persian languages derives directly from Vedic.

Sanskrit, on the other hand, is originally from India. The first Veda,  which was composed 15,000 years ago was the Rik Veda. It was in 
Vedic, and it was composed by those Aryans still north of India. 5,000 years later the Atharva Veda was composed in India in Sanskrit. 

Sanskrit language gave birth to 7 directions or Prakrita languages—people's languages:

1. Maghadi Prakrita 
2. Saorasenii Prakrita 
3. Paishachii Prakrita 
4. Pashcatya Prakrita 
5. Pahlavi Prakrita 
6. Malavii Prakrita 
7. Maharastrii Prakrita

These  Prakrita languages started 2500 to 3500 years ago. At that time Sanskrit was the linking language. From these seven Prakrita languages, the 
following languages evolved: 

1. Eastern—Maithali, Bengali, Angika, Ashami, Kaosholi 
Western—Bhojpuri, Chatisgari, Magahi, Nagpuri 

2. Harivani, Bhagili, Bumdili, Aradhi, Brajabasa 

3. Dogrii, Punjabi, Mahari Punjabi, Urdu 

4. Tajakii, Ujvekii, Pastu, Kashmirii 

5. Sindi, Multani 

6. Marwari, Gujrati, Kacchi, Malavi, Mevarii, Haraoti 

7. Marathii, Kaunkanii 

Bengali has the highest content of words directly derived from Sanskrit— 92%. Even some non-Indian languages contain a high proportion of Sanskrit. Thai is 80% Sanskrit, and Indonesian is 40%.

The Burmese are a multi-national and multi-lingual people. Among  the Indo-Burmese are Burmese, Kalciim, Mrtavan, Shan, and Arakan. 
Tamil comes from Dramil, which was further evolved into Northern demi and Southern demi. The Northern is Telugu and Southern is 
Kanada. Dravidian is of both Austric and Sanskrit origin. 

There are 4 derivatives from ancient Chinese:

1. Mandarin
2. Shanghaiise
3. new Chinese, 
4. Cantonese

Latin is divided into:

1. Continental (including German)
2. Oriento-demi (including French and Italian)
3. Occidento-demi (including Spanish and Portuguese). 


Scandinavian languages were influenced by Latin and Vedic, but they were predominantly Nordic.
- They are the base of the Anglo-Saxon group. 

Polish and the Slavic languages are of Alpine origin. 
- They were also influenced by Latin and Vedic. 

English is a mixture of Latin and Anglo-Saxon tongues. 

After the formation of Israel there arose a question of the linking language in the Middle East. 

Would it be modern Hebrew or the other  Semitic languages? 

These languages resulted from both Caucasian and  Negroid influences. 

Most European languages have some parallelism with Vedic, but not with Sanskrit.

Sanskrit was the people's language until about 3500 years ago. 

From Shiva's time (about 7000 years ago) until Krishna's time (about 3500 years ago) the Dravidians, Austrics, Mongolians and Aryans were generally united, and throughout India, Sanskrit was spoken. 

At that time most of the Aryans were still in the north. 
- Their language then broke into the seven prakrita language groups. 

**The first script in the world was Chinese.** 

Later came the Indian scripts Brahmi and Kahrosthii. 

After 2000 years, Brahmi died, and was replaced by Sarada in the northwest, Narada in the southwest, and Kutiila in the center and in the east.

Now almost every state of India has its own script. 

Intonation pertains to the duration given to particular vowels. 

For example, the southern portion of the United States has an intonation 
characterized by a drawl. Such differences are primarily due to racial 
and ethnological factors. 


## Mongolian Languages

There are 3 major Mongolian language groups:

1. Indo-Tibetan

This is in Tibet, Nepal, Bhutan, and northern India 

2. Indo-Burman

This is in Burma and east India—it contains more Sanskrit

3. Sino-Japanese

This is in Japan, China, Taiwan, Mongolia and Korea. It has pictorial script. 


## African Languages

African languages differ according to climate and rivers. 

Language there began in the southern part of the Sahara. As that language 
moved further south it created 27 major languages and dialects. 

In the northern reaches of the Sahara, the main language was Egyptian.

"Semitic" originally meant north of the Sahara. 

The Aryans and the Blacks met in the area of Palestine, and created the Semitic 
peoples. 
- They are thus a mixture of black and white. 

**The great original Egyptian civilization was black.** 

At that time, the Arabs were imposing and militant, so they destroyed much of the culture and language of Egypt and Persia.

60-70% of Persian is Vedic, whereas Afghani is mostly Sanskrit. 

One system of classification is according to the changes a language undergoes when there is a change in the subject. Thus, there are 4 groups:

1. Changes in the conjugation of the verb are affected by both 
the number and the gender of the subject. 

An example is French.

2. Changes in the verb are affected only by the number.

Examples are English and Sanskrit. 

3. Changes are affected only by the gender. 

Examples are Bhojpuri and Maetili. 

4. There is no change either way. 

Examples are Bengali and Dravidian. Here, the "to be" verb is also not necessary—it is understood.
