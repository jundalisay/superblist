Pythagoras saw the use of symbols in teaching as most necessary. This form of erudition was cultivated by nearly all the Greeks, as being most ancient. 

But it was transcendently honored by the Egyptians, and adopted by them in the most diversified way. 

Pythagoras paid great attention to it. 

Anyone who clearly unfolds the meanings and arcane conceptions of the Pythagoric symbols will develop the great rectitude and truth they contain. <!-- , and liberate them from their enigmatic form.  -->

They are adapted according to a simple and uniform doctrine, to the great geniuses of these philosophers, and deify in a manner which surpasses human conception. 

All those who came from Pythagoras' school adopted this mode of teaching, in their discourses with each other, and in their commentaries and annotations. 

<!-- For those who , and especially the most ancient Pythagoreans, and also those young men who were the disciples of Pythagoras when he was an old man, viz. Philolaus and Eurytus, Charondas and Zaleucus, and Brysson, the elder Archytas also, and Aristæus, Lysis and Empedocles, Zanolxis and Epimenides, Milo and Leucippus, Alcmæon, Hippasus and Thymaridas, and all of that age, consisting of a multitude of learned men, and who were above measure excellent -->

Their writings and books were not composed in a popular and vulgar diction, and in a manner usual with all other writers, so as to be immediately understood, but in such a way as not to be easily apprehended by those that read them.

This is because they adopted that taciturnity which was instituted by Pythagoras as a law, in concealing after an arcane mode, divine mysteries from the uninitiated, and obscuring their writings and conferences with each other.

Hence he who selecting these symbols does not unfold their meaning by an apposite exposition, will cause those who may happen to meet with them to consider them as ridiculous and inane, and as full of nugacity and garrulity. 

When, however, they are unfolded in a way conformable to these symbols, and become obvious and clear even to the multitude, instead of being obscure and dark, then they will be found to be analogous to prophetic sayings, and to the oracles of the Pythian Apollo. 

They will then also exhibit an admirable meaning, and will produce a divine afflatus in those who unite intellect with erudition. 

Nor will it be improper to mention a few of them, in order that this mode of discipline may become more perspicuous= Enter not into a temple negligently, nor in short adore carelessly, not even though you should stand at the very doors themselves. Sacrifice and adore unshod. 

Declining from the public ways, walk in unfrequented paths. Speak not about Pythagoric concerns without light. And such are the outlines of the mode adopted by Pythagoras of teaching through symbols.
