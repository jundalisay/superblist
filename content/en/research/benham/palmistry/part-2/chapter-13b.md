<!-- It is from the type and Chirognomic make-up of a subject that you must determine which interpretation should be given.  -->

In every case, the Girdle shows some nervousness and some ardor. 

But to reach a correct estimate of the extent of either, you must:
- first correctly estimate the subject
- then apply the line to him. 

The person will be have intense nervousness and dejection if:
- the Mount of Venus is flat and flabby
- the Life line runs close to the thumb
- the color of the hand is white
- the third phalanges of the fingers are waist-like
- the Heart line thin

In such a case, a Girdle of Venus will not indicate lasciviousness, because the physical make-up of the person preclude such a possibility. 

Hysteria will be likely.


On the other hand, the person will have much lasciviousness, with a taste for drink and general debauchery, if:
- the Girdle of Venus is with a large Mount of Venus that is swollen, grilled
- the third phalanges of the fingers are thick
- the first phalanges are short
- the Life line runs wide into the palm
- the Heart line is deep and red
- the Mounts of Mars are full
- the color of the hand is red, with black or any approach to auburn or red hair on the hands

In this case, it is not a sign of nervousness and hysteria.


A Girdle of Venus on such a hand must be given the full strength of its old traditional interpretation. 

All of the nervousness in such a subject will become nervous energy which will be expended in gratifying animal appetites.

So impress it upon your mind at once that the form of interpretation which you give to the Girdle of Venus must depend entirely upon the kind of subject on which it is seen. 

<!-- There is another danger from the Girdle of Venus, which comes to all types of hands which have it.  -->


## The Girdle of Venus as a Sign of Masturbation

The Girdle might show a transitory danger, or the formation of a permanent habit if not checked early in life. 

At the age of puberty, people with the Girdle of Venus tend to indulge in masturbation. 
- In people with animal hands, this arises from the passionate heat which finds its outlet in this way. 
  - With such people, the continuance of the habit is only slight because they quickly have relations with the opposite sex and do not continue it. 

In the very nervous hand, puberty brings a sense of desire.

- But in such weak physical natures, this is largely a menial condition. 
  - There is no real heat or warmth of physical passion.
  - The mind becomes inflamed and has lascivious dreams. 
  - Such people are full of imagination, but weak in physical heat. 
  - It gives them greater delight to think of intercourse than the actual experience. 
  - They easily fall victims to the habit of masturbation. 

{{< img src="/graphics/palm/524.jpg" alt="Masturbator's hand" cap="Masturbator's hand" >}}

The person will, because of his imaginings, do masturbation if:
- the lower third of the Mount of Moon is largely developed
- the hand is thin, bony
- the Mount of Venus is flat, Girdle of Venus 
- waisted third phalanges of the fingers
- Mounts of Mars is deficient
- Heart line is thin 


These people will find it hard to break the habit of masturbation because their lack of physical heat makes them prefer masturbation to actual intercourse. 

They:
- are shy, diffident, and retiring by nature
- do not court nor love the society of people in general, or of the opposite sex in particular.

Many such people are Saturnians.

In such a hand, if you look into the upturned palm intently, then look at the person without saying a word, an oozy perspiration will soon begin to form in the palm.

This will become more plentiful the longer you continue the experiment. 

Such subjects will not often deny that they masturbate. 

If these are seen in children's hands, ask the parents to give them good wholesome advice and plain talks to prevent the formation of this vicious habit.

The Girdle of Venus is usually a single deep line. 

This is most often seen on the least nervous hands. This is why it is not so frequently an indication of hysteria as of increase of animal appetites. 

Often, the Girdle is composed of broken fragments (525). 

This will increase:
- the nervousness
- the danger of hysteria
- the retiring disposition. 

If such subjects fall into bad practices, the habits are very hard to overcome. 

Often, the Girdle of Venus is composed of double or triple lines (526). These make its properties, whether of health or temperament, doubly strong. 

If the Girdle is composed of many broken lines (527) and the rest of the hand be a nervous one, the danger from hysteria is great and all nervous symptoms will be intensified. 

If with such a marking there are indications of female trouble (528) the subject will be a great sufferer, and nervous depression, ill-health, and constant discontent and unhappiness will surround her. 

These subjects should be taken to a specialist, who may relieve them, but often the real trouble is not known.

With such a marking you will frequently find very defective Life and Head lines.

If the Head line in this case should have islands, dots, crosses, or a star on it, there will be grave danger of insanity (529). 

The ultra-nervous condition shown by a bad Girdle of Venus will have its effect on every phase of life.

Defects in the Saturn or Apollo lines may be accounted for by a bad Girdle of Venus. 

They may come from either lasciviousness or ill-health; which one may be indicated by a Chirognomic examination and by the Main lines. With the Girdle of Venus, a factor which may be so potent in its operation, there will be many combinations in which it will play an important part. If the Head line slopes low into the Mount of Moon, and on it or near its termination a star, dot, cross, or island be seen, with a broken Girdle of Venus, and many lines in the hand (530), the subject is in grave danger of insanity, as a result of intense nervousness and excessive imagination.

This subject will be erratic, cranky, and hard to get along with. If a cross be seen on the Mount of Saturn, a broken Girdle of Venus, dots or islands in the Head line under Saturu, a grille on the Mount of the Moon, with brittle or fluted nails, the subject will be in grave danger from paralysis (531). If the hand be thick at the base, fingers thick, color red, lines deep and red, with a deep Girdle of Venus, and the lines of Life and Head short and ending in defects, the subject will be likely to die very suddenly at the age at which the Life line ends, as a result of dissipation and excess (532). 

If the hand be sensual in formation, with a Girdle of Venus which cuts a troubled Saturn line deeply, and a dot be seen on the Mount of Apollo, or on the Apollo line near the termination, the excesses of the subject will ruin his career and end in the entire loss of his reputation (533).

It will be noted in the foregoing illustrations that the Chirognomic type of the hand is taken into account, and that a broken Girdle of Venus indicates the nervous condition and a deep Girdle indicates its excessive side. 

If a deep Girdle of Venus cuts a line of Affection, the Heart line has drooping lines from it, the Head line becomes defective toward the end and terminates in a star, and the Saturn line is cut by a bar which stops it, the excesses of the subject will ruin his married life and cause great sorrow, finally ending in an impairment of the mental faculties, insanity, and the ruining of his career (534). 


You will see the Girdle of Venus in all kinds of hands. 

Some of the best men and women have had it. 
- Their careers have never suffered.

It has been argued that the added warmth imparted by the Girdle of Venus gives a greater richness to the character that can hold it within bounds.

From this standpoint it would be considered as an absolute blessing. 

But its presence may produce unpleasant results.

The difficulty of telling which meaning to give 

The Girdle has a positive or negative meaning when you fit the line to the type of hand which has it. Do not try to fit lasciviousness to every person on whom the Girdle is seen. 

A poor, trembling, nervous, cold-handed person with the Girdle should not be told that he indulges in great excesses.
- An extra cup of coffee or tea might mean a great dissipation to him. 
- Yet nost Girdles are found on such palms.
 <!-- it is on such subjects that you will find a large percentage of Girdles.  -->


Good judgment and a clean way of looking at things must be displayed in handling the Girdle of Venus, which, used with discrimination, will produce only good results for the practitioner. 

There are those who seek unpleasant sides to every character, and for such the Girdle has peculiar charms, but in the largest number of cases, pity and tenderness should be the feeling it inspires.
