People find it hard to assenting to these doctrines when they see philosophers being less wise and reasonable than those who never studied philosophy.

<!--  by experience, which shows that they who make pretensions to philosophy are often . 

applied themselves to the study, I should have here shortly explained wherein consists all the science we now possess, and what are the degrees of wisdom at which we have arrived.  -->


All the wisdom we ordinarily possess is acquired only in these 4 ways:

1. Through notions so clear that they can be acquired without meditation
2. Through sensory experience
3. Through the conversation of other men
4. Through the reading of books written by proper teachers 


<!-- persons capable of conveying proper instruction, for it is a species of conversation we hold with their authors. -->

Divine revelation is not one of these. This is because divine revelation does not conduct us by degrees, but elevates us at once to an infallible faith.


In all ages, great minds, properly called philosophers, have tried to find a 5th road to wisdom, more sure and elevated than the other four. They wrote about the search of first causes and true principles, from which we could derive all that can be known by man.

But none of them have succeeded. 

The first and chief whose writings we possess are Plato and Aristotle. 

<!-- They are the same except that  -->

Plato followed his master, Socrates.

Socrates, ingenuously confessed that:
- he could never find anything certain
- he wrote about certain principles to account for the other things

  <!-- was contented to write what seemed to him probable, imagining, for this end,  -->
 
Aristotle was the disciple of Plato for 20 years.
- He had less candour.
- He had no principles of his own. 

Instead, he completely reversed Plato's principles. 
- He proposed as true and certain what it is probable he himself never esteemed as such.

But Plato and Aristotle had acquired much judgment and wisdom by the 4 means.
- This raised their authority very high. 
- Those who came after them were willing to acquiesce in their opinions, than to seek better ones. 

Their chief question was: **Should we doubt all things? Or should we hold some as certain?**

<!-- This dispute led both sides into extravagant errors. -->


## The Middle Way

**Truth is the mean between the 2 opinions.**

Most disputes have this problem: each disputant departs from the middle truth in proportion to his spirit of contradiction. This causes errors in both sides.


1. Favor Doubt

Those who favored doubt extended it even to the actions of life, to the neglect of the most ordinary rules required for its conduct. Their error was not followed for a long time.


2. Favor No Doubt

Those who maintained the doctrine of certainty supposed that it depends on the senses and trusted entirely to them.

This was adopted by Epicurus. He affirmed, contrary to all the reasonings of the astronomers, that the sun is no larger than it appears.

Their error has been corrected to some extent by the doctrine that the senses are often deceitful.

<!-- Nevertheless, I do not know that this error was wholly removed by showing that  -->

Certitude is not in the senses, but in the understanding alone when it has clear perceptions. 

<!-- while we only possess the knowledge which is acquired in the first four grades of wisdom,  -->

We should:
- not doubt the things that appear to be true in what regards life. 
- esteem those things as so certain that we cannot change our opinions about them, even though constrained by the evidence of reason.

<!-- the conduct of life, nor  -->


Because of the ignorance of this truth, the majority of later philosophers blindly followed Aristotle. 

<!-- or, if there was any one to whom it was known, from neglect of it, -->
- They frequently corrupted the sense of his writings.
- They attributed to him various ideas which were not from him. 
 <!-- opinions which he would not recognise as his own were he now to return to the world. -->

These ideas were then taught in the schools. 
- Even those who did not follow Aristotle were imbued with these ideas in their youth.
<!-- ; and those who did not follow him, among whom are to be found many of the greatest minds, did yet not escape being , as these form the staple of instruction .. -->
- This made them believe that they could not rise to the knowledge of true principles.

 <!-- and thus their minds were so preoccupied that   -->

<!-- And though I hold all the philosophers in esteem, and am unwilling to incur odium by my censure, I can adduce a proof of my assertion, which I do not think any of them will gainsay, which is, that  -->

Most philosophers laid down principles on things that they did not perfectly know. 

For example, they knew that there was gravity in terrestrial bodies from seeing heavy bodies descend towards the center of the earth.
- But they do not know the nature of gravity, that is, the cause or principle in virtue of why bodies descend. 
- We must derive our knowledge of it from some other source.

The same may be said of:
- a vacuum and atoms
- heat and cold
- dryness and humidity
- salt, sulphur, and mercury
- etc

<!-- , and the other things of this sort which some have adopted as their principles.  -->

<!-- But no  deduced from -->
But an unclear principle cannot lead to conclusions even if the deduction is formally valid.

 <!-- which is not clear can be evident, -->

Hence, it follows that no reasonings based on such principles could;
- lead them to the certain knowledge of any one thing, nor
- consequently advance them in the search for wisdom.

If they did discover any truth, this was due to one or other of the 4 means above mentioned.

This does not mean I want to reduce the honour of those philosophers.

In travelling, when sometimes choose the wrong way to reach our destination. 
- This would make us go farther from our destination with each step, even if we think that each step gets us closer to it.
- In such a case, it would have been better to not have taken any more steps.

<!-- we turn our back upon the place to which we were going, we recede the farther from it in proportion as we proceed in the new direction for a greater length of time and with greater speed, so that, though we may be afterwards brought back to the right way, we cannot nevertheless arrive at the destined place as soon as if we had not moved backwards at all;  -->

Likewise in philosophy, when we use false principles, we actually go farther from our destination of knowing truth and wisdom.
- We think that we are cultivating wisdom when we deduce the diverse consequences from false principles.
- We think that we are philosophizing well, when in reality, we are only departing the farther from the truth.
- In this case, the most unlearned are ironically the most fitted to apprehend the truth.

 <!-- exactly in proportion to the care with which we  them, and apply ourselves to the deduction of diverse  from them, thinking that we are  -->

<!-- from which it must be inferred that they who have learned the least of all that has been hitherto distinguished by the name of philosophy . -->

How do we get to the true principles that can help us reach that highest degree of wisdom?

 <!-- wherein consists the sovereign good of human life,  -->

This is what my work is for. 

Only 2 conditions are required in true principles:

1. These principles are very clear
2. We can deduce all other truths from them

I easily prove that they are very clear

1. By rejecting all propositions that were in the least doubtful

Propositions cannot be rejected by this test when they are attentively considered. This is how I found those true principles.

<!-- are the most evident and clear which the human mind can know.  -->

A person who doubts all will doubt all, but will be unable to doubt his own existence. The reasoning thing will not be able to doubt itself. It cam doubt its body, but not its mind. 

<!-- Thus by considering that he who strives to doubt of all is unable to doubt that he is while he doubts, and that what reasons thus, in not being able to doubt of itself and doubting nevertheless of everything else, is not that which we call our body, but what we name our mind or thought,  -->

This mind is the first principle. This principle necessarily leads to following truths:
<!-- I have taken the existence of this thought for the first principle, from which I very clearly deduced the  -->
- there is a God who is the author of all that is in the world
- he is the source of all truth
- he cannot deceive us*

> *Superphysics Note: Here, Descartes' God matches the Positive Force in Superphysics. It is not the Supreme Being or Brahma.


<!-- have created our understanding of such a nature as to be deceived in the judgments it forms of the things of which it possesses a very clear and distinct perception.  -->

Those are all the principles touching immaterial or metaphysical objects. From these principles, I most clearly deduce the principles of physical or corporeal things:

1. There are bodies extended in length, width, and heigth

These are of diverse shapes and are moved in a variety of ways.

 <!-- Such are in sum the principles from which I deduce all other truths.  -->

2. By the fact that they have been known in all ages

They have been received as true and indubitable by all men. Only the existence of God has been doubted by some because they attributed too much to the perceptions of the senses, and God can neither be seen nor touched.
<!-- the exception only of -->

<!-- But, though all the truths which I class among my principles were known at all times, and by all men, nevertheless, there has been no one up to the present, who  -->

But no one, so far as I know, has adopted my principles as principles of philosophy.

<!-- : in other words, as such that we can deduce from them the knowledge of whatever else is in the world.  -->

Do my principles apply to the real world?

<!-- It accordingly now remains for me to prove that they are such; and it appears to me that I cannot better establish this than by  -->

This can be proven by the test of experience -- by inviting readers to use my work.

I have applied my principles on as many matters as I could. I hope that my readers will find it unnecessary to seek for any other principles to arrive at a complete knowledge that man is capable of. 

<!-- For, though I have not treated in it of all matters- -that being impossible—I think I have so explained all of which I had occasion to treat, that they who read it attentively will have ground for the persuasion that it is  -->

I arranged it in a question format so that they will see how their diverse questions are answered by my principles, but not by the principles of others. 

<!-- the most exalted knowledge of which the mind of ; especially if, after the perusal of my writings, they take the trouble to consider how many  questions are therein discussed and explained, and, referring to the writings of others, they see how little probability there is in the reasons that are adduced in explanation of the same questions by principles different from mine.  -->

People who are imbued with my doctrines will comprehend the writings of others easier.

<!-- , than those who do not know my principles.  
, and estimating their true value, than those who have not been so imbued; -->

This is precisely the opposite of those who accept the principles of ancient philosophy. Those who have studied ancient philosophy more are less fit for rightly apprehending the truth.

The reader should first go thorugh the whole of it, as he would a romance. He should not greatly strain his attention at the difficulties he might meet. 

If he wants to know their causes, he may read it a second time to discover the connection of my reasonings.

<!-- with the view simply of knowing in general the matters of which I treat; and that afterwards, if they seem to him to merit a more careful examination, and he feel a desire  -->

to ; but that he must not then give it up in despair, although he may not everywhere sufficiently discover the connection of the proof, or understand all the reasonings—it being only necessary to

He should mark with a pen the places where the difficulties occur. He should continue to read without interruption to the end.

If he reads the entire work for a 3rd time, he will discover the solution to those difficulties by himself*.

> *Superphysics Note: In this way, Descartes' work is like organized training data and the reader is like a machine learning algorithm that makes multiple passes on that data.


<!-- ; then, if he does not grudge to take up the book a third time, I am confident he will find in a fresh perusal the solution of most of the difficulties he will have marked before; and that,  -->

If any still remain, their solution will be found by reading the work completely again. 

<!-- I have observed, on examining the natural constitutions of different minds, that  -->

There are hardly any minds dull or slow of understanding as to be incapable of apprehending good opinions

<!-- , or even of acquiring all the highest sciences, if they be but conducted along the right road.  -->

This can also be proved by reason.

The principles are clear. Only the most manifest inferences should be deduced from them. Everyone with intelligence can comprehend the conclusions that flow from them.

<!-- no one is so devoid of intelligence as to be unable to -->

Everyone is entangled by prejudices. The most ardent students of the false sciences receive the greatest detriment from them.

, from which no one is entirely exempt, although it is they who have been 

, it happens very generally that people of ordinary capacity neglect to study from a conviction that they want ability, and that others, who are more ardent, press on too rapidly:

whence it comes to pass that they frequently admit principles far from evident, and draw doubtful inferences from them. 

This is why I want to assure those who are too distrustful of their own ability that there is nothing in my writings which they may not entirely understand, if they only take the trouble to examine them.

I warn those of an opposite tendency that even the most superior minds will need much time and attention to remark all I designed to embrace therein.


After this, that I might lead men to understand the real design I had in publishing them, I should have wished here to explain the order which it seems to me one ought to follow with the view of instructing himself. 

1. A man who has merely the vulgar and imperfect knowledge which can be acquired by the 4 means above should before all else, try to form for himself a code of morals,

 sufficient to regulate the actions of his life, as well for the reason that this does not admit of delay as because it ought to be our first care to live well. 

 2. He should study Logic.

 He should not study the Logic of the schools.

  for it is only, properly speaking, a dialectic which teaches the mode of expounding to others what we already know, or even of speaking much, without judgment, of what we do not know, by which means it corrupts rather than increases good sense

  he should learn the logic which teaches the right conduct of the reason with the view of discovering the truths of which we are ignorant;

   and, because it greatly depends on usage, it is desirable he should exercise himself for a length of time in practising its rules on easy and simple questions, as those of the mathematics. 

Then, when he has acquired some skill in discovering the truth in these questions, he should commence to apply himself in earnest to true philosophy, of which the first part is Metaphysics, containing the principles of knowledge, among which is the explication of the principal attributes of God, of the immateriality of the soul, and of all the clear and simple notions that are in us; the second is Physics, in which, after finding the true principles of material things, we examine, in general, how the whole universe has been framed; in the next place, we consider, in particular, the nature of the earth, and of all the bodies that are most generally found upon it, as air, water, fire, the loadstone and other minerals. In the next place it is necessary also to examine singly the nature of plants, of animals, and above all of man, in order that we may thereafter be able to discover the other sciences that are useful to us.
