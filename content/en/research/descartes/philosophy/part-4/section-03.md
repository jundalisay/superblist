## The Nature of Fire and its Distinction from Air.

[4.080] How can flame be ignited in these cavities? What is the nature of fire?

Terrestrial particles, regardless of their size or shape, individually follow the motion of the fire-aether. 

Thus, they take on the form of fire, just as they take on the form of air when floating among the air-aether globules, imitating their movement.

Therefore, the primary and principal difference between air and fire is that the particles of the fire-aether are much more rapidly agitated than those of air-aether.

The motion of the fire-aether is much swifter than that of the air-aether.

The denser particles of the earth-aether, such as those constituting the vapors of quicksilver, can assume the form of physical air. But it is not necessary for their preservation. 

On the contrary, it is purer, less prone to corruption, consisting only of the tiniest particles. 

The denser particles, unless continuously agitated by heat, naturally fall downward by their own weight and spontaneously shed the form of air. 

However, fire cannot exist without somewhat denser terrestrial particles, from which it is nourished and renewed.

## How Fire is First Ignited

[4.081] The globules of the air-aether:
- occupy all the spaces around the Earth large enough to contain them.
- mutually rest on each other in such a way that they cannot move independently (unless perhaps in a circular motion around their own axis), even though the matter of the first element, filling all the small spaces left by these globules, moves very rapidly within them, it cannot generate enough force in those places to carry away the terrestrial particles, which are all supported by each other and the globules of the second element.

Therefore, it cannot generate fire.

However, for fire to be first ignited somewhere, the air-aether globules must be expelled from the intervals between some terrestrial particles. 

These particles then, once separated and floating freely in the fire-aether, are swiftly carried away in its motion and propelled in various directions.


## How is Fire Sustained?

[4.082] To sustain this fire, the terrestrial particles must be dense, solid, and apt for motion. 

This way, when driven by the matter of the first element, which propels them, they have the force to repel celestial globules from the place where the fire is and to which they are ready to return. This action prevents these globules from occupying the intervals left by the first element initially, thereby breaking its force and extinguishing the fire.



## Why Does Fire Need Nourishment?

[4.083] When these terrestrial particles strike the globules, they cannot be prevented by them from moving further and leaving that place, where the fire-aether primarily exerts its force, resulting in the loss of the form of fire and turning into smoke. 

Therefore, no fire would last there unless, at the same time, some of these terrestrial particles, by striking a somewhat denser body, separated some solid particles from it. 

These particles, succeeding the former and carried away by the matter of the first element, continuously generate new fire.


## How Is Fire Sparked from Flint?

[4.084] Flints are hard, rigid, and friable.

<!-- To better understand these processes, let us first consider various methods by which fire is generated, then examine everything required for its sustenance, and finally, assess its effects. 

Nothing is more common than to strike fire from flint, and I believe this happens because  -->

Because of their hardness and rigidity, when struck by a hard body, the spaces between many of their particles, usually occupied by air-aether globules, become narrower.

These air-aether are compelled to spring out. They leave only the fire-aether around them.

Due to their friability, once these particles of flint are no longer pressed by the impact, they spring apart. The fire-aether, found solely around them, composes the fire.

Thus, if `A` is flint with visible globules of the air-aether in its anterior particles, `B` represents the same flint when struck by a hard body. Its channels have become narrower, leaving only the matter of the first element. 

`C` shows the same flint already struck, with some particles separated and having only the matter of the first element around them, resulting in sparks of fire.

## How is Fire Produced from Dry Woods?

[4.085] If wood, no matter how dry, is struck in this way, it will not emit sparks because it is less hard.

The first part of it that encounters the striking body bends toward the second part before the latter starts bending toward the third. 

Thus, globules of the air-aether do not leave many of their intervals simultaneously but depart successively, sometimes from one, sometimes from another. 

However, if the wood is rubbed vigorously for a long time, the unequal agitation and vibration of its particles, resulting from this friction, can shake loose globules of the second element from many of their intervals, separating them from each other. This action then transforms them into fire.


## How is Fire Produced from the Collection of Sunbeams?

[4.086] Fire can also be ignited by directing many sunbeams through a concave mirror or convex glass onto a particular spot.

The action of these sunbeams has globules of the air-aether as their substrate. It is much more vigorous than the usual motion of these globules.

Since it originates from the fire-aether of the Sun, it has sufficient speed to ignite fire.

Additionally, so many rays can be focused at the same time that they have enough force to agitate terrestrial particles with the same speed.



## How is Fire Ignited by Violent Motion Alone?

[4.087] It matters little from which cause the terrestrial particles first begin to move very rapidly. 

Even if they were previously motionless, once they only float in the matter of the first element, they acquire the most rapid agitation. This is the same principle by which a ship, not tethered by any ropes, cannot remain stationary in a rushing stream but is carried away with it.

Although these terrestrial particles do not yet adhere to the first element in this motion, if they are rapidly agitated by any other cause, they immediately shake loose from each other and the globules of the second element around them, starting to float in it.

Thus, they will sustain their motion. Therefore, any highly accelerated motion is sufficient to ignite fire. Such motion is often found in lightning and whirlwinds when high clouds, falling into lower ones, explode intercepted air, as I explained in Meteoris.
