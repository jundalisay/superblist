[4.120] On burning, tasteless, and acidic waters.

Indeed, the particles that are evaporated are distinguished into various types. First, leaving aside those that are so mobile and fine that they alone cannot ignite any substance other than air, after these, the finest of all, which can be easily evaporated, are those that, enclosed in vessels carefully sealed by chemists and collected simultaneously, form burning waters or spirits. These are often extracted from wine, wheat, and many other substances. Next are sweet or tasteless waters, such as those distilled from plants or other bodies. In the third place, there are corrosive and acidic waters or sharp juices, which are extracted from salts not without a significant force of fire.

[4.121] On sublimates and oils.

Some thicker particles, such as those of quicksilver and salts, which adhere to the tops of vessels and solidify into hard bodies, require a considerable force to be lifted into the air as a sublimate. However, oils are the most difficult to evaporate from hard and dry bodies; this must be done not so much by the force of fire as by a certain art. Since their particles are thin and branched, a strong force would break and tear them apart before they could be drawn from the channels of these bodies. Therefore, a copious amount of water is poured over them, and the smooth and slippery particles of the water, permeating these channels, gradually extract and carry them away.

[4.122] How changing the degree of heat changes its effect.

In all these cases, the degree of heat must be observed because, with its variation, the effect varies in some way. Many bodies, when first subjected to gentle heat and then gradually to stronger heat, dry out and emit various particles. They emit particles that they would not release but rather would entirely liquefy if tormented from the beginning with strong fires.

[4.123] On lime.

The manner of applying fire also affects its result. Some bodies, if heated all at once, become liquid, but if a strong flame licks their surface, it turns them into lime. Indeed, all hard bodies that are reduced to the finest powder solely by the action of fire, namely by the breaking or expulsion of some of their finer particles that previously joined the rest, are commonly said by chemists to be converted into lime. There is no other difference between ashes and lime than that ashes are the remnants of those bodies, a considerable part of which has been consumed by fire, whereas lime consists of those bodies that almost entirely remain after complete combustion.

[4.124] On glass, how it is made.

The ultimate effect of fire is the conversion of lime and ashes into glass. After the finest particles of the bodies being burned have been extracted and rejected, the remaining ones, which are left as lime or ashes, are so solid and thick that they cannot be lifted upward by the force of fire. They usually have irregular and angular shapes, so that, lying on each other, they do not adhere to each other mutually, nor do they touch each other except perhaps in very tiny points. However, when a powerful and prolonged fire continues to exert its force on them, that is, when the finer particles of the third element, along with the globules of the second, rapidly move around them in all directions, their angles gradually wear down, their surfaces become smooth, and some of them may even bend. In this way, flowing and merging with one another, not just at points but on small surfaces, they form glass by connecting with each other.

[4.125] How its particles are connected.

It should be noted that when two bodies with surfaces of some width encounter each other directly, they cannot approach each other so closely that some space does not intervene. This space is occupied by the globules of the second element. However, if one is moved over the other obliquely, nothing prevents them from immediately touching each other, at least if the surfaces of both are smooth and flat. But if they are rough and uneven, they are gradually smoothed and flattened by this very movement. Therefore, it must be assumed that the disconnected particles of lime and ashes are represented here by bodies B and C, while the connected particles of glass are represented by bodies G and H. And from this single difference, which is clear in the intense and prolonged action of fire, all the properties of glass are acquired.

[4.126] Why it is liquid when glowing and easily takes on any shape.

Indeed, when glass is still glowing, it is liquid because its particles move easily with the force of fire, with which they were already smoothed and bent before. When it begins to cool, it can take on any shape. This is common to all bodies liquefied by fire; for while they are still liquid, their particles easily adapt to any shape, and when they later solidify, they retain the same shapes they last assumed. Glass can also be drawn into very thin threads like hairs because its particles, already starting to solidify, flow more easily over one another than they can be separated from each other.

[4.127] Why it is very hard when cold.

When glass has completely cooled, it is very hard but also very brittle, becoming more brittle the faster it cools. Indeed, the cause of its hardness is that it consists only of particles that are sufficiently thick and inflexible, which adhere to each other not by the interweaving of branches but by direct contact. Many other bodies are softer because their particles are flexible, or they end in some flexible branches that, being mutually attached, connect them. However, no adhesion between two bodies can be stronger than the one that arises from their immediate contact; they touch each other so that neither is in motion to be separated from the other. This happens to the particles of glass as soon as they are removed from the fire because their thickness, proximity, and uneven shapes prevent them from being preserved in their motion against the surrounding air.

[4.128] Why it is very brittle.

Nevertheless, glass is very brittle because the surfaces on which its particles touch each other are very small and few. Many other softer bodies are more difficult to break because their parts are so intertwined that they cannot be separated without breaking and tearing many of their branches.

[4.129] Why its fragility decreases if it cools slowly.

It is also more fragile when it cools quickly than when it cools slowly; indeed, its channels are quite wide when glowing because, at that time, much matter of the first element, along with the globules of the second and perhaps some of the finer particles of the third, pass through them. When it cools spontaneously, they become narrower because only the globules of the second element passing through them require less space. If cooling occurs too quickly, glass becomes hard before its channels can be constricted in this way. As a result, these globules always later exert force to separate its particles from each other. Since these particles are joined solely by their own contact, one cannot be separated from another even slightly without immediately separating more others, those close to it on the surface where this separation began. Thus, glass is entirely shattered. For this reason, those who make glass vessels remove them gradually from the furnaces to cool slowly. If cold glass is exposed to fire so that one part is heated much more than others nearby, it will break in that part. This happens because its channels cannot be dilated by heat, with the channels of neighboring parts remaining unchanged, so that it is separated from them. But if glass, first slowly heated and then gradually subjected to stronger heat, is heated equally in all parts, it will not break because all its channels will be dilated equally and at the same time.



[4.130] Why it is transparent.

Furthermore, glass is transparent because, during its formation, it is liquid, and the material of fire flowing around its particles carves numerous channels through which the globules of the second element, passing freely, can transfer the action of light in all directions along straight lines. It is not necessary for these channels to be perfectly straight but only uninterrupted; so that, for example, if we imagine glass to consist of perfectly spherical and equal particles but so thick that globules of the second element can pass through the triangular space that must remain between three mutually touching spheres, that glass will be completely transparent, even though it is much denser than the glass we currently have.

[4.131] How it becomes colored.

However, when metals or other bodies are mixed with the materials from which glass is made, whose particles resist fire more and are not as easily smoothed as others that compose it, it becomes less transparent and acquires various colors depending on how these harder particles more or less block its channels in different ways.

[4.132] Why it is rigid like an arch; and generally, why rigid bodies, when bent, spontaneously return to their original shape.

Moreover, glass is rigid, so that indeed it can be bent somewhat by an external force without breaking, but afterwards, it springs back with force like an arch and returns to its original shape. This is evident when it is drawn into very thin threads. And this property of springing back generally applies to all hard bodies whose particles are connected by immediate contact, not by the interweaving of branches. For since they have numerous channels through which some matter is constantly moving, as there is no vacuum, and their shapes are suitable for providing free passage to this matter, having been formed by its action, such bodies cannot be bent without varying somewhat the shape of these channels. This causes the particles of matter, accustomed to passing through them, to impinge on their walls, creating an opposing force to restore the original shape. Indeed, if, for example, in a loose arch, the channels through which the globules of the second element usually pass are circular, it is to be supposed that in a tense or bent arch, they are elliptical, and the globules striving to pass through them impinge on their walls along the smaller diameters of these ellipses. Thus, they have the force to restore the shape of the arch. Although the force in each globule of the second element is small, because many are constantly attempting to traverse many pores in the same arch, the combined forces of all of them can be significant. A long-tense arch, especially if made of wood or some not very hard material, gradually loses the force of springing back because the shapes of its channels, through prolonged friction of the particles of matter passing through them, gradually adapt more and more to their dimensions.

[4.133] On the magnet. Repetition of what is required from the above to explain it.

So far, I have attempted to explain the natures of air, water, earth, and fire, commonly considered the elements of this globe we inhabit, along with their principal forces and qualities. Now, it follows that I also address the magnet. Since its force is diffused throughout this entire globe, there is no doubt that it belongs to its general consideration. Let us now recall to ourselves the striped particles of the first element, which were quite accurately described earlier in the article 87 and following of Part III. Moreover, let us consider all that was said in Part III, article 105 to 109, about star I, applying it here to the Earth, and let us assume that there are many channels in its central region, parallel to its axis, through which the striped particles, coming from one pole, can freely go to the other. And these channels must be so excavated to their size that those receiving the striped particles from the Southern pole cannot receive any others coming from the Northern pole, and vice versa, those receiving Northern ones do not admit Southern ones. This is because, just like coils, they are twisted in one direction or the other. Moreover, the same particles can only enter through one part of these channels, but cannot return through the opposite part due to the very thin extremities of the branches bent in spirals within these channels toward that part along which they usually progress. Hence, after these striped particles have traversed through the entire Earth along straight or equivalently straight lines parallel to its axis, passing from one hemisphere to the other, they return through the surrounding ether to the same hemisphere through which they initially entered the Earth. Thus, they again permeate it, composing a kind of vortex there.

[4.134] There are no suitable channels for receiving striped particles in air or water.

Moreover, since I have shown that from that ether, through which the striped particles were said to return from one pole to another, four different bodies could be generated, namely the inner crust of the Earth or the metallic part, water, the outer earth, and air, and, as mentioned in Part III, article 113, no traces of channels suitable for receiving the striped particles have been left except in the thicker particles of that ether, it should be noted here that all these thicker particles initially converged towards the inner crust of the Earth and none of them could be present in water or air. This is because there are no sufficiently thick particles there, and because, being fluid bodies, their particles constantly change their position. Therefore, if there were channels there once, corrupted by this continuous movement, they would have been destroyed by now.

[4.135] There are also no channels in any bodies of the outer earth except in iron.

Furthermore, since it has been stated that the inner crust of the Earth consists of partly branched particles attached to each other and partly others that move through the branched intervals here and there, such channels cannot exist in these more mobile bodies due to the reason mentioned. They can only exist in the branched ones. As for the outer earth, no channels were indeed present in it initially, as it was formed between water and air. However, since various metals have ascended from the inner Earth to this outer one, although all those formed from the more mobile and solid particles should not have such channels, certainly that which consists of branched and thick but not so solid particles cannot be without them. And it is very reasonable to believe that iron is such.

[4.136] Why such channels exist in iron.

For no other metal is so difficult to be bent by the hammer, resists fire less, or can be rendered less fusible without the addition of another substance. These three characteristics indicate that its fragments are more branched or angular than those of other metals, and hence, they are more firmly connected to each other. Nor does it matter that some of its masses easily melt upon the first exposure to fire; at that time, their fragments are not yet attached to each other, and therefore, they are easily agitated by the heat. Furthermore, although iron is harder and less fusible than other metals, it is also one of the least dense, and it easily corrodes with rust or is eroded by strong acids. All of which indicates that its particles are not denser than those of other metals, such as the thicker ones, but that many channels are contained in them.

[4.137] How they exist even in each of its fragments.

I do not want to affirm here that there are complete holes in each fragment of iron, like coiled structures, through which the striped particles pass. Nor do I want to deny that many such holes may be found in them. It will suffice here to assume that halves of such holes are engraved on the surfaces of each of the fragments in such a way that, when these surfaces are properly joined, they form complete holes. And it can be easily believed that these thicker, branched, and perforated particles of the inner Earth, from which iron is made, were divided in such a way that half of these perforations remained on the surfaces of the fragments separated from them. These fragments were then pushed up through the veins of the outer earth, propelled by the spirit or acrid juice permeating them, gradually ascending into its cavities through exhalations and vapors.
