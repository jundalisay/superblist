## How it is Produced by the Mixture of Various Bodies.

[4.088] However, almost never is this motion alone the cause of fire. It is almost always mixed with air exhalations whose nature is such that they easily transform either into flame or, at least, into a luminous body. Hence, will-o'-the-wisps around the Earth, lightning in clouds, and shooting and falling stars in the high air are ignited. 

Exhalations consist of the tiniest particles, divided into many branches, wrapping other somewhat denser particles derived from pungent juices or volatile salts. 

These branches are usually so minute and close-packed that nothing can pass through their interstices except the fire-aether.

However, the particles enveloped by these branches often form other larger intervals that the globules of the second element tend to fill. At that point, the exhalation does not ignite, but it may sometimes happen that these spaces are occupied by particles of another exhalation or spirit. When these expel the former along the second element, they immediately leave their place, and, with their motion, generate fire.


## Fire In Lightning and Shooting Stars

[4.089] In lightning or shooting stars, the cause that compiles multiple exhalations simultaneously becomes apparent due to the descent of one cloud into another. However, in tranquil air, when one exhalation, densified and at rest due to cold, is easily penetrated by another coming from a warmer place or consisting of particles more suitable for motion or even impelled by a gentle wind, it rushes into its pores. As a result, it expels particles into the second element. Since the particles of the first exhalation are not yet so tightly connected that they cannot be separated by the impact of the others, they burst into flame. I believe this is how shooting stars are ignited.


## In Those that Shine but Do Not Burn: Falling Stars.

[4.090] When, however, the particles of an exhalation have coalesced into a substance so dense and viscous that they do not separate much, they emit only some light, similar to that seen in rotting wood, fish preserved in salt, drops of sea water, and the like.

The only reason for the light is that the globules of the second element are pushed away by the matter of the first element, as is evident from the aforementioned. Since the intervals between many joined terrestrial particles are so narrow that only the first element can fit, even if this first element does not have enough power to separate them, it easily has enough to drive the surrounding globules of the second element away. I think falling stars are such particles; their material, having fallen to the ground, is often found to be viscous and tenacious. Although it is not certain that this viscous material had light, there could have been some faint flame adhering to it.


## In Drops of Sea Water, Rotting Wood, and the Like.

[4.091] In the case of drops of sea water, the nature of which we explained earlier, it is easy to see how light is produced. 

When the flexible particles of these drops, mutually entangled, remain together, the rigid and smooth ones, due to the force of a storm or any other motion, are ejected from the drop. These rigid particles, vibrating like little spicules, easily expel globules of the second element from their vicinity, thus producing light. 

In rotting wood, fish that are beginning to dry, and similar substances, I think light arises solely because, while they are glowing, many passages are so narrow that they admit only the matter of the first element.

[4.092] [&] In Those that Heat Up but Do Not Shine: Like Enclosed Hay.

The fact that particles of some spirit or liquid, by passing through the channels of a hard or even liquid body, can sometimes ignite fire is demonstrated by wet hay enclosed in a space.

Also, lime sprinkled with water, all kinds of fermentations, and several chemical liquids known to alchemists, which, when mixed together, heat up and sometimes even catch fire. 

The reason fresh hay, if stored before drying, gradually heats up and spontaneously catches fire is no different from many spirits or juices that, accustomed to flowing through the pores of green plants from their roots to their tips, stay for some time in excised herbs. If these herbs are enclosed in a narrow space during this time, the particles of these juices migrating from one herb to another find many channels in the already drying herbs, slightly narrower than those that can admit them together with the globules of the second element. Therefore, flowing through these channels, they surround only the matter of the first element, which, swiftly driven by them, acquires the agitation of fire. 

For example, if the space between two bodies, B and C, represents one of the channels of a green herb, and small loops 1, 2, 3, surround it, taken as particles of juices or spirits usually conveyed by globules of the second element through such channels, and the space between bodies D and E is another narrower channel of a drying herb, which, traversing it, the same particles 1, 2, 3 can no longer surround the second element but can only have the first around them; it is clear that they should follow a moderate motion of the second element between B and C but a very swift motion of the first between D and E. 

It does not matter that only a very small quantity of this first element is found around them. It is enough that they adhere to it entirely. As we see a ship descending in a stream, it easily follows its course when it is so narrow that it almost touches its banks on both sides, just as it does when it is widest.

Therefore, such swiftly moving particles have much more power to separate the particles of surrounding bodies than the first element itself. Just as a ship colliding with a bridge or obstacle shakes it more forcefully than the water of the river from which it is carried away. Therefore, rushing into the denser particles of the hay, they easily separate them from each other, especially when many of them rush from different sides. When they separate enough of them and carry them away, there is fire; when they merely shake and do not yet have the power to separate many from each other, they slowly heat and spoil the hay.


## In Lime Sprinkled with Water and Others.

[4.093] When a hard body is heated by the addition of some liquid, it happens because many of its channels are of such a size that only the particles of this liquid, surrounded by the matter of the first element, can pass through. I think a similar explanation applies when one liquid is poured into another: one of them always consists of ramified particles, somehow intertwined and knotted, and thus takes the place of a hard body, as previously understood about the exhalations themselves.

[4.094] How Fire can be Ignited in the Cavities of the Earth.

In all these ways, not only on the surface of the Earth but also in its cavities, fire can be ignited. There, the sharp spirits of dense exhalations can penetrate in such a way that they ignite flames within them. The fragments of rocks or flint, worn away by the secret flow of water or other causes, falling from the vaults of the cavities to the substrate soil, can both explosively expel intercepted air and ignite fire by the collision of flint. Once one body has conceived fire, it easily communicates it to other nearby bodies suitable for receiving it. For the particles of fire, meeting the particles of those bodies, move them and carry them away. However, this pertains more to the preservation of fire than its generation, which will be discussed later.

[4.095] How a Candle Burns.

Consider, for example, a lit candle AB. Imagine that in the entire space CDE, through which its flame extends, many particles of wax or any other oily material from which this candle is made float, as well as many globules of the second element. However, both these and those have the matter of the first element so innate in them that they are carried away by its motion. Although they often touch and push each other, they do not support each other from every side, as they usually do in places where there is no fire.

[4.096] How Fire is Sustained in it.

However, the matter of the first element, which is abundantly present in this flame, always tends to escape from the place where it is because it moves very swiftly. It tends to rise upward, that is, to move away from the center of the Earth, as it is lighter than the globules themselves, which occupy the meatus of the air. Both these globules and all the terrestrial particles of the surrounding air try to descend into its place. Therefore, they would immediately smother the flame if it consisted only of the first element. However, the terrestrial particles, constantly emanating from the wick FG, as soon as they are immersed in the first element, follow its course. They repel the air particles ready to descend into the flame and thus preserve the fire.


[4.097] Why its flame becomes pointed, and smoke issues from it.

Since these tend mainly upward, it happens that the flame is usually pointed. And because they act much faster than the air particles they repel, they cannot be hindered by them from proceeding further towards H, where they gradually deposit their agitation and turn into smoke.

[4.098] How air and other bodies feed the flame.

If the smoke could not find any space in the entire air, because there is no vacuum anywhere except where it exits from the flame, it would return with a circular motion towards it. Specifically, as the smoke ascends to H, it displaces the air towards I and K. This air, by licking the tip of the candle B and the roots of the wick F, approaches the flame and contributes to its sustenance. However, this alone would not be enough, due to the thinness of its parts, unless it brought with it many particles of wax, agitated by the heat of the fire, through the wick. Thus, the flame must be constantly renewed to be preserved, and it remains not the same, as rivers to which new waters constantly flow.

[4.099] On the circular motion of air towards fire.

The circular motion of air and smoke can be experienced whenever a large fire is kindled in a closed room. For if the room is closed in such a way that, besides the chimney pipe through which the smoke exits, only one opening is left, a strong wind will be felt continuously, through this opening, heading towards the fire, to the place where the smoke is going.

[4.100] On those things that extinguish fire.

From this, it is clear that two things are required for the preservation of fire: first, that there be terrestrial particles in it, which, impelled by the first element, have the power to prevent it from being suffocated by air or other liquids placed above it. I only speak of liquids placed above the fire because, carried solely by their gravity towards it, there is no danger of being extinguished by those beneath it. Thus, the flame of an inverted candle is smothered by a liquid that otherwise sustains it. Conversely, other fires can be made in which there are terrestrial particles so solid, so many, and so vibrated with such force that they repel water poured on them and cannot be extinguished by it.

[4.101] What is required for a body to be suitable for sustaining fire.

The second thing required for the preservation of fire is that it adheres to some body from which new matter can access it, to the place where the smoke is going. Therefore, this body must have many particles that are sufficiently thin, depending on the ratio of preserving fire, and they must be so joined together, either among themselves or even with thicker ones, that, driven by the particles of that fire, they can be separated both from each other and also from the neighboring globules of the second element, thus converting them into fire.

[4.102] Why the flame of wine spirit does not burn linen.

I say that the particles of this body must be sufficiently thin, depending on the ratio of preserving fire. For example, if the spirit of wine ignites a linen cloth, this very fine flame will consume all the spirit of wine but will not touch the linen because its particles are not thin enough to be moved by it.

[4.103] Why wine spirit ignites very easily.

Indeed, the spirit of wine easily feeds the flame because it consists only of very thin particles and has some branches so short and flexible that they do not adhere to each other. In that case, the spirit would turn into oil. However, they are arranged in such a way that they leave many extremely small spaces around them, which can be occupied not by the globules of the second element but only by the matter of the first.

[4.104] Why water is difficult.

On the other hand, water seems very adverse to fire because it consists of particles not only somewhat thicker but also smooth and glossy. Therefore, nothing hinders the globules of the second element from surrounding and following it everywhere. Furthermore, being flexible, it easily enters the channels of bodies that burn, and, by repelling the particles of fire, prevents others from igniting.

[4.105] Why the force of large fires is increased by water or salts thrown in.

However, some bodies are such that particles of water thrown into them help fire because, bouncing back with force, they ignite themselves. Hence, even with a small amount of water thrown into large flames, they are increased. Salts, in particular, are more effective: as their particles are rigid and oblong, they vibrate like spicules in the flame and, by striking other bodies, have great force to shake their minutiae. Therefore, they are usually added to melt metals.

[4.106] What kind of bodies easily burn.

Those commonly used for feeding fire, such as wood and the like, consist of various particles, some of which are very fine, others slightly thicker, and gradually others thicker, with most of them being branched and many meatus interlacing them. This allows the particles of fire, entering these channels, to quickly move the finest and then the moderate ones, and with their help, the thicker ones; thus, they swiftly shake off the celestial globules, first from narrower intervals and then from the remaining ones. They carry all of them away (except for the thickest ones, from which ashes are made).

[4.107] Why some things ignite, and others do not.

When such particles, which exit from the burning body, are so numerous that they have the power to expel celestial globules from some adjacent space, they fill that space with flame. If they are fewer, a flame without smoke is produced, which may gradually creep through the meatus of its funnel, finding material to consume. This can be observed, for example, in those cords or wicks used in war for igniting gunpowder.

[4.108] Why fire lasts a while in embers.

Certainly, if it has no such material around it, it is not preserved unless the pores of the body to which it adheres need some time to dissolve all its particles so that it can free itself. This can be seen in burning coals, which, covered with ashes, retain fire for many hours solely because that fire is inherent in certain very thin and branched particles, which, though moved very quickly, can only be separated one after another, and perhaps before they can exit in this way, they must be subdivided into even more.
