## How were these bodies generated? First, The General Motion Of Celestial Globules.

[4.015] The production of material bodies on Earth depends on 4 principal actions:

1. The general motion of air-aether globules
<!-- celestial -->

2. Gravity

3. Light

4. Heat

The continuous agitation of the air-aether globules is so great that it carries:
- the Earth around the sun in a year
- things in Region 3 daily around the Earth

 <!-- but also to perform many other actions in the meantime in various ways. -->

<!-- And because, in whatever direction they begin to move in this way, they continue as much as  -->

The air-aether travels in straight lines as much as possible. 
<!-- , or deflecting as little as possible from straight lines:  -->

And so they mix with the particles of the earth-aether to compose all the bodies of Region 3 of the Earth.
<!-- these celestial globules -->
<!-- , produce various effects in them, three of which I will note here. -->



## The First effect of This First Action is to make Bodies Transparent.

[4.016]  The air-aether in the earth-aether makes all terrestrial bodies that are liquid and of particles of earth-aether so fine that these globules are carried in all directions around them, transparent. 

When they move continuously through the passages of these bodies from side to side, and have the power to change the positions of their particles, they easily form straight or nearly straight paths suitable for the action of light in them. 

This is why there is pure liquids on Earth, consisting of fine particles, are transparent. 

Mercury's particles are coarser. They cannot admit the air-aether <!--  celestial --> globules everywhere around them.

Ink, milk, blood, and the like are not pure liquids. They are interspersed with many tiny particles of solid bodies.
 
Transparent solid bodies came from transparent liquids. Their particles retained the same position that they were placed in by the globules of air-aether when they were not yet adhering to each other.

<!-- And as for solid bodies, it can be observed that all those  when they were formed and still liquid remained transparent, and their parts  -->

On the other hand, the particles of all opaque liquids adhere to each other by some external force. 
- They do not obey the motion of the globules of the mixed matter. 
- They have many passages left in these bodies through which air-aether globules continuously flow here and there.
  - This is because these passages are interrupted and closed in different places.

But they cannot transmit the action of light which needs straight or nearly straight paths.



### How Can a Solid and Hard Body Like Glass Have Enough Passages To Transmit Light Rays?

[4.017] Think of apple-spheres enclosed in a mesh, tightly bound so that these apples, adhering to each other, form a single body.
<!-- To understand how hard bodies can have enough passages to provide a passage for light rays coming from any direction,  -->

It will contain passages through which particles can pass through. 

Pour small lead globules above it. Those globules will easily fall towards the center of the Earth in straight or nearly straight lines, due to their gravity. This is regardless of the direction this body turns.

Thus, it will be transparent, despite being solid and hard.

The celestial globules that transmit rays of light are like these lead balls. 

<!-- do not need to find straighter and more numerous passages in terrestrial bodies through which they  than the leaden globules descending between these apples. -->


## The Second Effect Of This First Action: Separating One Body From Another And Purging Liquids

[4.018] When the particles of 2 or more terrestrial bodies, especially liquids, are confusedly joined together, the air-aether globules tend to separate some from others.

Thus, these distinguish them into various bodies. 

They also tend to mix others more accurately, arranging them in such a way that each droplet of the liquid formed from them is entirely similar to all other droplets of the same liquid.

When air-aether globules move through the passages of liquid terrestrial bodies, they constantly displace the particles of the third element that come in their way until they arrange and order them among others so that they no longer oppose the motions of each other, or, when they cannot be arranged in this way, until they have separated them from the rest.

Thus, we observe that from dregs, certain liquids, not only upward and downward (which could be attributed to gravity and levity) but also towards the sides of the vessel, are expelled, and the wine subsequently clarified, although it still consists of various particles, appears transparent and no denser at the bottom than at the top. The same should be assumed for other pure liquids.



## The Third Effect: Making Round Drops Of Liquids 

[4.019] In Meteoris, I have explained that the third effect of air-aether globules is to make drops of liquids round. 

<!-- hanging in the air or any other liquid, round, as I have explained . -->

These air-aether particles have to travel much longer around a water droplet than through physical air. To resume their usual straight-line path, they press on the droplet to make it perfectly round.

This is because if one part of the droplet protrudes, then it would deflect the air-aether motion and prevent its straight-line movement and cause it to impact that protruding part more. 

<!-- in the surrounding air and always move as much as possible in straight lines or approximately straight lines, those in the air are less hindered by their motions along lines deflecting as little as possible and can continue them more easily if the droplet is perfectly spherical.  -->

<!-- For if there is a part on the surface of this droplet that protrudes beyond the spherical shape, celestial globules flowing through the air will impact it more than the others.  -->

This will cause the air-aether to push the protruding part towards the center of the droplet. 

Likewise, if any part of the droplet is sunk closer to the center than the rest of the surface, the internal air-aether in the droplet itself, will push that sunken area more forcefully from the center.

And so all air-aether contribute to making a spherical droplet.

And since the angle of contact, the only one that deviates from a straight line, is always smaller than any rectilinear angle, and in no curved line except a circular one is equal everywhere: 

it is certain that a straight line can never be more equally, and less deviate in each of its points than when it degenerates into a circular line.



## The second action called gravity.

[4.020] The force of gravity does not differ much from this third action of air-aether globules.

These globules, by their own motion alone, carries them indiscriminately in all directions.
- This makes them uniformly press all particles of each droplet towards its center, making the droplet round.

The same motion, impeded by the resistance of the Earth's mass pushes all the Earth's parts towards the center.

This is the gravity of terrestrial bodies.



##  All Particles of the Earth, if Considered Alone, are Light, Not heavy

[4.021] A vacuum contains nothing that can impede or assist the motions of other bodies.

<!-- To fully understand its nature, it must first be noted that  -->

<!-- earth-aether -->
Assuming that:
- all the spaces around the Earth not occupied by the air-aether were a vacuum
- the Earth rotates around its axis for 24 hours with its own motion so that all its parts not very firmly connected to each other would leap towards the sky from time to time, just as sand thrown in a whirlwind will immediately disperse in all directions.

Then the Earth should be considered light, not heavy.



## Where Does the Lightness of the Air-Aether Come From?

 <!-- celestial matter -->

[4.022] In reality:
- there is no vacuum
- the Earth rotates by the surrounding air-aether by permeating it entirely and passing through all its pores

 <!-- celestial matter, , it has the character of a resting body.  -->

<!-- On the other hand,  -->

The air-aether has no force of gravity or anti-gravity as long as it totally agrees in the motion that carries the Earth.

<!-- , has no force of gravity or levity;  celestial matter -->
<!-- gravity or levity;  -->

But in reality, they are hindered from their straight-line paths by their impact with the Earth. 

 <!-- as long as its parts have more agitation than they spend in this, therefore always hindered by the  in following , they always recede from it as much as they can and thus consist in their lightness. -->


##  How All Parts Of The Earth Are Pushed Downwards By the Air-Aether and Thus Become Heavy
<!-- This Celestial Matter, -->

[4.023] The particles of air-aether are set in motion by many different motions at the same time. But all their actions converge so as to stand in perfect equilibrium, opposing each other.

The mass of Earth hinders their motions by obstruction. This makes them tend equally in all directions to recede from the Earth and its center. 

 <!-- its vicinity and to be removed from it as if from its center unless some external cause establishes diversity in this matter.  -->

<!-- Several such causes can be thought of; however, whether their effects are such that they are detected by the senses is not yet known to me. -->


Each part of air-aether matter cannot exert its force to move away from the Earth unless, as they ascend, some terrestrial parts are depressed and propelled downward to take their place. 

All the spaces around the Earth are occupied either by particles of:
- earth-aether, or
- air-aether

All globules of this air-aether have an equal tendency to move away from it, individually, they do not have the force to push others of their kind from their places.

However, when such a tendency is not as strong in the particles of earth-aether, whenever some of them are above others, they must exert this force on those below. 

Thus, the gravity of each terrestrial body is not caused by the surrounding air-aether but by the air-aether which, if the body descends, immediately ascends to its place.

Consequently, it is equal to it in magnitude. 

For example, let `B` be a terrestrial body existing in the middle of the air, consisting of several particles of the earth-aether equal in mass to the air surrounding it. Therefore, it has fewer or narrower pores that has the air-aether.

If this body B descends towards `I`, an equal mass of physical air will ascend to its place.

And since there is some celestial matter opposing an equal quantity of similar celestial matter contained in the air mass, it renders it idle.

Likewise, there are some terrestrial parts in the air mass that oppose an equal number of other terrestrial parts of body B, and they do nothing to them. However, subtracting these from both sides, the remaining celestial matter in this air mass acts on the remaining terrestrial parts of body B, and in this alone, its gravity consists.


[4.024] How much gravity does a Body Have?

To ensure a proper calculation, it must be considered that 

There is also some air-aether in the channels of this body `B`. This air-aether is opposed to an equal quantity of similar air-aether contained in the physical air, rendering it idle.

Likewise, there are some terrestrial parts in the air mass that oppose other terrestrial parts of body B. 

They do nothing to them. 

Subtracting these from both sides, the remaining air-aether in this air mass acts on the remaining terrestrial parts of body B. 

In this alone, its gravity consists.


## The Quantity of Gravity Does Not Correspond To The Quantity Of Matter In Each Body

[4.025] The air-aether that causes gravity is made up of:
- the air-aether
- the air-aether that is mixed with the fire-aether

Furthermore, it includes those terrestrial particles that, following its course, move faster than others, such as all those composing the air. 

The fire-aether, all else being equal, has a greater force to push downward on terrestrial bodies than the globules of the air-aether because it has more agitation.

The air-aether globules, in turn, have more force than the physical air that they carry along with them for a similar reason. 

Hence, gravity alone cannot easily estimate how much terrestrial matter is contained in each body.

It is also possible that, for example, even though 

A mass of gold weighs 20 times more than an equal volume of water.

 it may not contain four or five times more terrestrial matter. This is because the same amount must be subtracted from both due to the air in which they are weighed. Additionally, in the water itself, as in all other liquid bodies, there is buoyancy due to the motion of its particles relative to hard bodies.

[4.026] Why bodies do not gravitate in their natural places.

It should also be considered that there is a circular motion in every movement of bodies that move together, as already explained above. No body falls due to its gravity unless, at the same moment, another body of equal size and less gravity rises. Hence, in vessels, no lower drops of water or other liquid press against those above, nor do individual parts of the bottom press unless they are opposed by as many drops as there are vertically above them. For example, in vessel ABC, the drop of water 1 is not pressed by the drops 2, 3, 4 above it because, if they were to fall, other drops like 5, 6, 7, would have to ascend in their place, which, being equally heavy, hinder their descent. However, these drops 1, 2, 3, 4, by joining forces, press against the part of the bottom B because, if they cause it to descend, they themselves will also descend, and the parts of the air 8, 9, which are lighter than them, will ascend in their place. But the same part B of the vessel is not pressed by more drops than these 1, 2, 3, 4 or others equivalent to them because, at the moment when this part B can descend, not more drops can follow. Hence, numerous experiments on the gravity, or rather, if one may say so, the gravitation of bodies, which seem miraculous to those who poorly understand philosophy, can be easily explained.

[4.027] Gravity presses bodies downward toward the center of the Earth.

Finally, it should be noted that although the particles of celestial matter are moved by various motions at the same time, all their actions so conspire and oppose each other that, from the fact that the masses of the Earth obstruct their motion, they all equally tend to move away from it and are as if removed from its center, unless some external cause establishes diversity in this matter. Several such causes can be devised, but whether their effects are such that they are perceptible remains uncertain to me.



[4.028] Regarding the third action, which is light, and how it moves air particles.

The force of light, as it emanates from the Sun and stars, spreading to all parts of the sky, has already been sufficiently explained. It remains only to note here that its rays, having descended from the Sun, interact with the particles of Earth in various ways. Although, when considered in itself, it is nothing more than a certain pressure acting along straight lines extended from the Sun to the Earth, because this pressure is not applied uniformly to all particles of the third element composing the upper region of the Earth, but now to one, now to another, and even at times to one extremity of the same particle and then to another, it can be easily understood how various motions are induced in these particles. For example, if AB is one of the particles of the third element composing the upper region of the Earth, leaning towards another particle C, and with many other particles like D, E, F interspersed between them: these intervening particles may hinder the Sun's rays G, G from pressing on the extremity B but not on A. Thus, the extremity A will be depressed, and B will be raised. And since these particles constantly change their positions, shortly afterward, they will be opposed to the Sun's rays tending toward A, but not to those tending toward B. Consequently, the extremity A will rise again, and B will be depressed. The same happens with all Earth particles reached by the Sun's light, and hence, all are moved by the light.

[4.029] Regarding the fourth, which is heat, what it is, and how it persists after light is removed.

This agitation of terrestrial particles, whether originating from light or any other cause, is called heat, especially when it is greater than usual and affects the senses. The designation of heat is related to the sense of touch. It should be noted that each of these terrestrial particles, once set in motion, persists in its motion according to the laws of nature until it is stopped by some other cause. Therefore, heat originating from light continues to exist for some time after the light is removed.

[4.030] Why heat penetrates deeper than light.

Furthermore, it should be noted that the terrestrial particles, impelled by the Sun's rays, agitate others nearby to which these rays do not reach. These, in turn, agitate others, and so on. Since the entire half of the Earth is always illuminated by the Sun, so many of these particles are set in motion that, although light remains on the first opaque surface, heat generated by it must penetrate to the innermost parts of the middle region of the Earth.

[4.031] Why it rarefies almost all bodies.

Finally, it should be noted that these terrestrial particles, when agitated by more than usual heat, cannot be contained in the usual narrow space, as when they are at rest or less in motion. This is because they have irregular shapes, occupying less space when connected in a certain way and at rest than when they are continually moving and separating. Thus, heat rarefies almost all terrestrial bodies, but to varying degrees depending on the arrangement and shape of the particles they consist of.
