## [4.015] How were these bodies generated? First, the general motion of celestial globules.

The production of these bodies I will explain shortly afterward, but before I do that, three or four principal actions, on which it depends, must be considered here. 

1. The general motion of celestial globules

2. Gravity

3. Light

4. Heat

The continuous agitation of the air-aether globules is so great that it carries:
- the Earth around the sun in a year
- things in Region 3 daily around the Earth

 <!-- but also to perform many other actions in the meantime in various ways. -->

<!-- And because, in whatever direction they begin to move in this way, they continue as much as  -->

The air-aether travels in straight lines as much as possible. 
<!-- , or deflecting as little as possible from straight lines:  -->

And so these celestial globules mix with the particles of the earth-aether to compose all the bodies of Region 3 of the Earth.

<!-- , produce various effects in them, three of which I will note here. -->


## [4.016] The First effect of This First Action is to make Bodies Transparent.

The air-aether in the earth-aether makes all terrestrial bodies that are liquid and of particles of the third element so fine that these globules are carried in all directions around them, transparent. 

For when they move continuously through the passages of these bodies from side to side, and have the power to change the positions of their particles, they easily form straight or nearly straight paths suitable for the action of light in them. 

This is why there is no pure liquid on Earth, consisting of fine particles, that is not transparent. 

Mercury's particles are coarser than to admit celestial globules everywhere around them.

Ink, milk, blood, and the like are not pure liquids. They are interspersed with many tiny particles of solid bodies.

And as for solid bodies, it can be observed that all those transparent liquids when they were formed and still liquid remained transparent, and their parts retained the same position in which they were placed by the globules of celestial matter when they were not yet adhering to each other. 

On the other hand, all opaque liquids have particles connected and adhering to each other by some external force, not obeying the motion of the globules of the mixed matter. 

For although many passages are left in these bodies too, through which celestial globules continuously flow here and there, since these passages are variously interrupted and closed in different places, they cannot be suitable for transmitting the action of light, which can only be conveyed through straight or nearly straight paths.
