<!-- The parts of the aethers are very diverse. Most of them take the form of the fire-aether or the air-aether through breaking and dividing by collision with one another. -->

The aether that became the earth-aether had 2 kinds:

1. Those which had shapes so large and impeding that they joined with the particles that they collided with.

This allowed them to become larger instead of breaking up. 

2. Those which began as the most massive that they could shatter the others but not be shattered themselves.

Whether these two were initially agitated or not, they afterwards had to move with the same agitation as the air-aether that contained them.

- If they were moving faster than the air-aether, then they would necessarily push it upon colliding with it. 

In a short time, they had to transfer to the air-aether their agitation. 

- If they were not moving, they were surrounded everywhere by the air-aether. 

They necessarily had to follow the air-aether, just as boats follow the water they are in.


## Quantum Tunneling and Star Formation

Massive and solid bodies that float on water always have much more force than the water. 

This allows them to continue their motion, even though they get their motion from the water alone. An example are the largest and most heavily-laden boats. 

By contrast, the very light floating bodies, like those lumps of white scum floating along the shores during storms, have less force to continue moving.

Imagine 2 rivers that join at some point and then separate again before their waters have a chance to mix.
- Rapid, heavy boats from River `A` will will be easily able to pass into River `B`.
- Slow, light boats from River `A` will turn away from River `B` and will be thrown back by the force of the water toward the places where it is the least rapid.

For example, River 1 is `ABF` and River 2 is `CDG`. They come from 2 different directions and meet at `E` and then turn away from there. 

`AB` goes towards `F`. `CD` goes towards `G`.
- Boat `H` in River 1 starts from `A` towards `B` passses through `E` towards G. 
- Reciprocally, Boat `I` in River 2 starts from `C` and goes towards `F`.

If both both meet at the passage `E` at the same time, the larger and stronger boat will break the smaller and weaker. 

By contrast, lighter bodies such as leaves and feathers that float at `A` are pushed by the course of the water, not toward `E` and toward `G`, but toward `B`, where the water is less strong and rapid than at `E`. 

This is because at `B` it takes a curved path and not a straight line.  

**These light bodies, but also others heavier and more massive can join upon meeting and that, turning then with the water that bears them, several together can compose large balls such as you see at** `K` and `L`.

The more solid and larger ones with massive particles are `L`. These go toward `E`. 

The less solid and smaller ones are `K`. These go toward `B`.
