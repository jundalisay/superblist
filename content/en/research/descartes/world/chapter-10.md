There are several things to note concerning the planets. 

1. They all tend toward the center of the heliosphere that contains them. 

They can never arrive at those centers since the sun and fixed stars already occupy the center. 



Let:
- `saturn` follow the course of the air-aether of the heliosphere towards the circle `K`


{{< img src="/graphics/physics/helio.jpg" alt="Heliospheres" >}}

If `saturn` had a bit more force to continue its motion in a straight line compared to the air-aether around it, then it would go towards circle `Y`, making it farther from the `sun`, instead of always following circle `K`.

The air-aether around it at orbit `Y` would move faster and even are a bit smaller (or at least are not larger) than those at `K`. 

They would give it more force to pass beyond toward `F`, allowing it towards the circumference of that system without stopping. 

It would easily pass into another heliosphere. Instead of being a planet, it would become a comet.

No star can stop anywhere in all that vast space between circle `K` and the circumference of the heaven `FGGF`, through which the comets take their course. 

In addition, the planets of necessity cannot have more force to continue their motion in a straight line than have the air-aether at `K`, when those planets move with the same agitation along with these air-aether. All bodies that have more are comets.


`saturn` has less force than the air-aether surrounding it. 
- That air-aether that follow it and that are placed a bit lower than it can divert it. Instead of following circle `K`, it descends towards `jupiter`.

`saturn` can be exactly as strong as the air-aether that will then surround it. This is because this air-aether is more agitated than those at `K`.

It will also agitate the planet more (being smaller). It will not be able to resist the planet as much. 

In this case, the planet will:
- remain perfectly balanced in the middle of them
- from there take its course in the same direction as they about the sun, without being at one time or another more or less distant from the sun, except insofar as they can also be more or less distant from it.

But if `saturn` were at `jupiter` still has less force to continue its motion in a straight line than has the air-aether there, it will again be pushed lower by the air-aether towards Mars, and so on. 

Until finally, it is surrounded by the air-aether that has neither more nor less force than it.

Thus, there can be diverse planets, some more and others less distant from the sun, such as:
- Saturn
- Jupiter
- Mars
- Earth
- Venus
- Mercury.

Of these, the lowest and least massive can reach to the sun's surface. 

But the highest never pass beyond circle `K` which, although very large in comparison with each planet in particular, is nevertheless so extremely small in comparison with the whole of heaven `FGGF` that it can be considered as its center.



The air-aether beyond circle `K` are incomparably smaller than the planets. 

How can the air-aether have more force than the planets to continue their motion in a straight line?

This force does not depend solely on the quantity of matter in each body, but also on its surface area. 

**When 2 bodies move equally fast, if one contains twice as much matter as the other, it also has twice as much agitation.** 
- **But it does not follow that it has twice as much force to continue to move in a straight line.** 
- Rather, it will have exactly twice as much if, in addition, its surface is exactly twice as extended, because it will always meet twice as many other bodies resisting it, and it will have much less force to continue if its surface is extended much more than twice.

The air-aether is round. 
- Of all shapes, they have the most matter within the least surface.

The planets, on the other hand, are made up of earth-aether with very irregular shapes and sizes. 
- They have large surfaces in proportion to the quantity of their matter. 

Thus, the planets can have a greater ratio of surface area to volume than most of these air-aether

Yet, the planets have a smaller ratio than some of the smallest parts that are closest to the centers. 

Given 2	 balls, the smaller ball will have more surface per matter than the large ball.

If we push a large ball composed of many tree branches confusedly joined and piled on top of one another (as one must imagine are the parts of matter of which the planets are composed), even if it be pushed by a force entirely proportional to its size, it will not be able to continue its motion as far as would another ball, very much smaller and composed of the same wood, but wholly massive. 

By contrast, we could make another ball of the same wood and wholly massive, but so extremely small that it would have much less force to continue its motion than had the first.

This first ball can have more or less force to continue its motion according as the branches composing it are more or less large and compressed.

This is how:
- diverse planets can be suspended within circle `K` at diverse distances from the `sun`
- it is not simply those that outwardly appear the largest, but those that are the most solid and the most massive in their interior, that are the most distant.

Boats following the course of a river never move as fast as the water that bears them. The larger boat cannot move as fast as the smaller. Even though the planets follow the course of the air-aether without resistance and move with the same agitation as it,  that is not to say thereby that the planets ever move entirely as fast as the matter. 

The inequality of their motion must bear some relation to the inequality between the size of their mass and the smallness of the air-aether that surround them. 

This is because the larger a body:
- the easier it is for it to communicate a part of its motion to other bodies
- the more difficult it is for the others to communicate to it something of their own motion. 

Many small bodies all working together to act on a larger one may have as much force as it. 

But they can never make it move as fast as they in all directions. This is because if they agree in some of their motions which they communicate to it, at the same time they most certainly differ in others which they cannot communicate to it.

This leads to 2 things:

1. The air-aether must make the planets turn around the sun, but also about their own center, except when there is some cause that hinders them.

Consequently, the air-aether creates small heliospheres around the planets. These move in the same direction as the main heliosphere.

2. If two planets, unequal in size, but at the same orbit,  <!-- but disposed to take their course in the heaven at the same distance from the sun -->, and the planets are such that the one is exactly as much more massive as the other is larger, then the smaller will be faster than the larger.

It will have to link itself to the small heaven around that larger planet and turn continually around it.

The air-aethers at `A` move faster than the planet `e`. They push `e` towards `Z`. 

`e` in return pushes the air-aethers towards `B` instead of towards `D`.  This is because the air-aethers are inclined to continue their motion in a straight line. And so they must go outside of the orbit `ACZN` which they create, rather than towards the `sun`. 

Passing from `A` to `B`, they force planet `e` to turn with them around its center. 
- This then lets them go from `B` to `C`, then to `D` and to `A`. 

Thus, they form a particular heliosphere around the planet. They continue to move from the West towards the East both:
- around the sun and
- around its own center.

`m` is disposed to take its course along orbit `NACZ` just like the planet `e`.  `m` moves faster because it is smaller. 

Wherever it might have been in the heliosphere at the start, it shortly would tend towards the exterior surface of the small heliosphere `ABCD`.
- After joining `ABCD`, it must always follow the orbit around `e`, along with the air-aethers that are at the surface.

If `e` did not exist, `m` would have exactly as much force as the air-aether of territory `ABCD` to go along the orbit `NACZ`. 
- `m` would have a bit more force to turn along orbit `ABCD` because it is smaller. This is why it always moves as far away as possible from the center `e`. 

In the same way, a stone being moved in a sling always tends to move away from the center of the orbit that it is forming.

Yet `m`, being at `A`, will not move off towards `L` because the air-aether at `L` would push it back towards orbit `NACZ`.
- Likewise, when it is at `C`, it will not move towards `K` because the air-aether there would force it to ascend again towards that same orbit `NACZ`. 

- `m` will not be flung from `B` towards `Z`, much less from `B` towards `N` because it only has the speed to go to `C` or `A`.
<!-- just as it could not go as directly from  easily nor as fast as it could toward C and toward A.[49]  -->
  - Thus, it must remain attached to the surface of the small territory `ABCD` and turn continually with it around `e`. 

<!-- That is what impedes its forming another small heaven about it, which would make it turn again about its own center. -->

<!-- I shall discuss how one can find more planets joined together and taking their course about one another, such as those that the new astronomers have observed about Jupiter and Saturn. -->

<!-- I only mention Jupiter and Saturn to represent to you (by the planet marked T) the earth we inhabit and (by that marked Â¢ [Moon]) the moon that turns about it. -->
