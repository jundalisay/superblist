There are several things to note concerning the planets. 

1. They all tend toward the center of the stellar gravitational territory that contains them. 

They can never arrive at those centers since the sun and stars already occupy the center.

Assuming `saturn` follows the orbit of the air-aether at circle `K` 
- If `saturn` had a bit more force to continue its motion in a straight line relative to the air-aether around it, then it would go farther towards outer orbit `Y`

<!-- , making it farther from the `sun`, instead of always following circle `K`. -->

The air-aether around it at orbit `Y` would move faster and would be smaller (or at least are not larger) than those at `K`. 

They would give it more force to pass beyond towars `F`, allowing it to move towards the edge of that system without stopping. 

It would easily pass into another territory. Instead of being a planet, it would become a comet.

No star can stop anywhere in all that vast space between circle `K` and the circumference of the heaven `FGGF`, through which the comets take their course. 

In addition, the planets of necessity cannot have more force to continue their motion in a straight line than have the air-aether at `K`, when those planets move with the same agitation along with these air-aether. All bodies that have more are comets.


Assuming `saturn` has less force than the air-aether surrounding it. 
- The air-aether between the orbit of `jupiter` and `saturn` can divert it towards the orbit of `jupiter`.
- Once at the orbit of `jupiter`, `saturn` will become as strong as the air-aether in that orbit.
- This is because this air-aether there is more agitated than those at `K` [the orbit of `saturn`].
  - They will also offer less resistance because they are smaller. 

In this case, `saturn` will remain perfectly balanced in the orbit of `jupiter`.

<!-- - from there take its course in the same direction as they about the sun, without being at one time or another more or less distant from the sun, except insofar as they can also be more or less distant from it. -->

But if `saturn` were at the orbit of `jupiter` and has even less force to continue its motion in a straight line than the air-aether there, it will again be pushed closer to the sun by the air-aether near the orbot of `mars`, and so on until it is in an orbit that has air-aether that matches its force. 

Thus, there are diverse planets at varying distances from the sun:
- Saturn
- Jupiter
- Mars
- Earth
- Venus
- Mercury.

Of these, the lowest and least massive can reach to the sun's surface. 

But the highest or farthest can never pass beyond orbit `K`.

 <!-- which, although very large in comparison with each planet in particular, is nevertheless so extremely small in comparison with the whole of heaven `FGGF` that it can be considered as its center. -->

The earth-aether beyond circle `K` are incomparably smaller than the planets. 

How can the air-aether have more force than the planets to continue their motion in a straight line?

This force does not depend solely on the quantity of matter in each body, but also on its surface area. 

**When 2 bodies move equally fast, if one contains twice as much matter as the other, it also has twice as much agitation.** 
- **But it does not follow that it has twice as much force to continue to move in a straight line.** 
- It will only have twice the force if its surface is also twice than the other body.
  - This is because it will meet twice as many other bodies resisting it, and it will have much less force to continue if its surface is increased more than twice.


The air-aether is completely round. 
- Round shapes have the most matter within the least surface.

The planets, on the other hand, are made up of earth-aether with very irregular shapes and sizes. 
- They have large surfaces relative to the quantity of their matter. 
- Thus, the planets can have a greater surface area to volume ratio than most of these air-aether
  - Yet, the planets have a smaller ratio than some of the smallest air-aether that are closest to the center of the territory. 

Given 2	air-aether balls, the smaller ball will have more surface per matter than the large ball.

For example, make 3 clay balls.
- Ball 1 and 2 have the same amount of clay, but Ball 2 is compressed to half the size of Ball 1. 
  - Ball 2 would roll farther than Ball 1
- Ball 3 will have much less amount of clay packed into a much smaller ball
  - Ball 3 would not roll farther than Ball 1 
- Ball 1 can move farther the more it is compressed and less farther the less it is compressed

This is why of the planets at within orbit `K`:
- are at varying distances from the `sun`
- the ones at the outer parts are the largest, most solid, and massive
