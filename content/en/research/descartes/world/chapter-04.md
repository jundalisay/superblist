Why can't we sense the aether? <!-- air compared to other bodies?  -->

If we could sense it, we will free ourselves from an error with which we have had since childhood, when we believed that there were no other bodies around us except those that could be sensed. 

Thus, if <!-- air --> the aether were one of them, then <!-- because --> we would sense it so very faintly that it could not be <!--  at least could not be --> as material nor as solid as those other bodies [matter] that we sense more clearly.[15]


### Property 1: The Aether Fills All

All bodies, both hard and liquid, are made from the same <!-- matter --> aether. 

The aether is most solid and occupies the least space when they are compacted -- where each part is touched on all sides by the others that surround it.

It follows that:
- liquid bodies have void* if there can be a void anywhere
- hard bodies do not have void. 

Because of this void, the particles of the liquid can much more easily press and arrange themselves against one another than those of hard bodies.

> *Superphysics note: Here, the aether-void is one of the properties of the aether 


For example, if you place powder in a jar, you can shake the jar and pound against it to make room for more powder. But, if you pour liquid into it, the liquid spontaneously arranges itself in as small a place as one can put it. 

Philosophers do experiments to show that there is no void in nature[16]. 

In all spaces that people think are empty and only have air, there is actually the same <!-- matter --> aether that we use to sense <!-- are at least as full, and as full of the same matter, as those where we sense --> other bodies.


### Property 1b: Voids Need to be Filled

Why would nature cause the heaviest aethereal bodies to rise and the most solid aethereal bodies to break? 

Nature does this in certain machines which have particles that do not touch one another yet keep the machine in operation. 

<!-- --as one experiences her doing in certain machines, rather than to suffer that any of their parts should cease to touch one another or to touch some other bodies--and yet permit the parts of air--which are so easy to bend and to be arranged in all manners--to remain next to one another without being touched on all sides, or even without there being another body among them that they touch?  -->

Water in a well goes up the pipe of a pump because of a void in that pipe. Likewise, the water in clouds fall in order to fill the ground that is void of water.  <!-- , if there were even some little void among the parts of the bodies that they contain? -->[17]

Liquids only move because there is some empty space among them, at least in the places where they left as a consequence of their <!-- mio from which they depart by virtue of their being in --> motion.

<!-- The parts of   But you could propose to me here a rather considerable problem, to wit, that the parts composing  liquid bodies cannot move incessantly   , as I have said they do,  unless  -->


### Property 1c: The Filling Leads to Circular Motions

This is explained by the circular motion of all the motions in the universe. <!-- I would have trouble responding to this, had I not recognized through various experiences that all the motions that take place in the world are in some way circular. --> 

When `Body 1` leaves `Place A`, it always enters into `Place B`. The body in `Place B` leaves and enters `Place C`, and so on until the last body occupies `Place A` in the same instant that it is left by `Body 1`.[18] 

Thus, there is no void among them both when they are moving and not moving. This circular movement does not mean a motion in a perfect circle. <!--  than when they are stopped. And note here that it is not thereby necessary that all the parts of bodies that move together be exactly disposed in the round, as in a true circle, nor even that they be of equal size and shape; for these inequalities can easily be compensated for by other inequalities to be found in their speed. -->

We do not notice this circular movement because we are used to conceiving of the aether as an empty space.

<!-- When bodies move in the air, we do not usually notice these circular motions because  -->

But look at fish swimming in a pool. If they swim at the bottom of the water, they do not cause the water to move even if they swim at great speed. 

This means that the water that they displace ahead of them is not pushed in all directions. Instead, the water only goes to fill the space that the fish left behind, in a circular motion. 

<!-- push before them does not push on all the water of the pool, but only the water which can perfect the circle of the fishes' motion and return to the place they leave behind.[19]  -->

<!-- This experience suffices to show how these circular motions are easy for nature and familiar to her. -->

This shows the circular motions of Nature. 

### Property 2: All Motions are Circular

**All motions are circular.** When the wine in a cask does not flow through an opening at the bottom because the top is completely closed, it is improper to say that it is caused by horror vacui. 

The wine has no mind to fear anything. Even if it had one, why would it fear that void which is nothing but a chimera?

The wine cannot leave the cask because:
- outside, everything is as full as it can be
- the wine cannot go down because that space is occupied by the air
  - that air has nowhere to go in the universe unless one opens the top of the cask and let the air enter as to allow the wine to take its place

I do not want to make certain that there is no void at all in nature because:
- my discourse would become too long if I explained the whole universe
- my experiences of the universe not enough to prove it, although they are enough to persuade us that the spaces where we sense nothing are filled with the same aether, and contain at least as much of that aether, as those occupied by the bodies that we sense.

Thus, when a vessel is full of gold or lead, it has the same amount of aether than when it is empty. 

This will be strange to those who only think that reality is <!-- physical.  --> limited to the world that they can touch. But when you have considered for a bit what makes us sense a body or not sense it, I am sure you will find nothing incredible in the above.

<!--  may well seem strange to many whose [powers of] reasoning do not extend beyond their fingertips and who think there is nothing in the world except what they touch.   -->

We cannot sense all the things around us. There are some things that we can sense sometimes, and some things that we can never sense. 

<!-- Far from all the things around us being sensible, it is on the contrary those that are there most of the time that can be sensed the least, and those that are always there that can never be sensed at all. -->

- The heat of our heart is quite great. But we do not feel it because it is always there. 
- The weight of our body is not small, but it does not discomfort us. 
- We do not even feel the weight of our clothes because we are accustomed to wearing them. 

We cannot sense any body unless it is the cause of some change in our sensory organs, i.e. An object moves which causes a subsequent movement in <!-- unless it moves in some way, --> the aether <!-- small parts of the matter --> that make up our <!-- of which those --> organs.

The objects that are not always present can well do this if they have enough force. If they corrupt something by their action, that something can be repaired afterwards by nature, when they are no longer acting. 

But if those sensory matter <!-- that continually touch us ever had the power to --> always affected the aether of our senses to the point that they separate them from sensing the aether, an ability that we had at the start of our life, then our senses will resist the sensing of the aether. This will cause us to lose that sense. 

<!-- produce any change in our senses, and to move any parts of their matter, --> <!-- in order to move them they had perforce to separate them entirely from the others at the beginning of our life
, and thus they can have left there only those that completely resist their action and by means of which they cannot be sensed in any way. -->

So it is no wonder that there are many spaces around us where we sense nothing, even if there is the aether. <!-- in which we sense no body, even though they contain bodies no less than those in which we sense them the most. -->

<!-- The coarse air that we inhale and is converted into wind when agitated, that appears solid when enclosed in a balloon, and that is composed only of exhalations and smoke is as solid as water or earth.  -->

<!-- Here one should follow the common opinion of the philosophers, who all assure us that it is rarer, as one also easily recognizes from experience.  -->

<!-- ### The Bodies Within the Aether -->

### Property 2b: Gaps in the Aether Creates Perpetual Motion

A drop of water that evaporates takes up more space than that occupied by the droplet because of the in-between space. It follows that the aether has a lot of in-between spaces. 

<!-- For the parts of a drop of water, separated from one another by the agitation of heat, can make up much more of this air than the space that held the water can contain. Whence it follows most certainly that there is a great quantity of small intervals among the parts of which the air is composed; for there is no other way to conceive of a rare body.  -->

But, because the in-between spaces in the aether cannot be void, it means that such aethereal spaces are filled up with other bodies. 

<!-- these intervals cannot be empty I conclude from all this that of necessity there are mixed with the air some other bodies, either one or several, which fill as exactly as possible the small intervals left among its parts.  -->


<!-- Now there remains to consider only what these other bodies can be; thereafter I hope it will not be difficult to understand what the nature of light can be. -->
