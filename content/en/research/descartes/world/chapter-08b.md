## Spacetime Becomes Electromagnetism

The aether particles that broke off from air-aether during collisions gained:
- more speed than the air-aether because they had to travel farther at the same amount of time. 
- the ability to change shape so that it could fit anywhere

**They became the fire-aether.**

<!-- the aethereal air were broken and had the small points of their angles dulled from rounding off. These necessarily had to go faster than the aethereal air.  -->

<!-- It went faster because it had to go off to the side through very narrow passages and out of the small spaces left between the parts of the air-aether as they collided head-on. It had much more of a path than the air-aether to traverse in the same time. -->

The excess fire-aether needed to fill the small gaps in the round air-aether necessarily go around them and must draw back toward the centers around the air-aether. 
<!-- which those parts turn, -->

This is because the air-aether occupies all the other, more distant places. 
<!-- parts of the second] -->

At those centers, the remaining <!-- first element --> fire-aether must compose perfectly liquid and subtle round bodies. 


## The Inverse Square Law Comes From Circular Motion

These incessantly turn much faster than, and in the same direction as, the parts of air-aether surrounding them. 

The parts of the fire-aether have the force:
- to increase the agitation of those parts to which they are closest and
- in moving from the center toward the circumference, to push the parts of fire-aether in all directions, just as they push one another.

This action we perceive as light. 

<!-- We shall take one of those round bodies composed purely of the  -->
<!-- matter of the first element  -->

Let us assume that round bodies of pure fire-aether are the stars. 

<!-- , of the new world I am describing to you.  -->

The air-aether turns around those stars as stellar gravitational territories ['the heavens'].

Imagine, that:
- the points `sun`, `barnard`, `sirius`, and `alphacentauri` are the centers
- all the air-aether of the gravitational territory `FFFFGG` turns around the `sun`
- all the air-aether of the gravitational territory `HGGH` turns around the star `alphacentauri`, and so on for the others.

Thus, each star has a stellar gravitational territory.
- Since the number of stars is indefinite, so too is the number of stellar gravitational territories. 

**The firmament is the breadthless surface separating all the gravitational territories from one another.**


The particles of the air-aether towards `F` or `G` are more agitated than those toward `K` or `L`.

In this way, the speed of the air-aether decreases little by little from the outside edges of each gravitational territory towards their center area such as:
- the sphere `KK` around the `sun`
- the sphere `LL` around `alphacentauri`. 

It then increases little by little from there to the centers of the gravitational territory because of the agitation of the stars at the center. 

Thus, the air-aether towards `K` draws there a complete circle around the `sun`.

Those towards `earth`, which is 10 times closer to the sun, can draw 10 circles (as they would do if they moved only equally fast), but perhaps more than 30.[42]

Again, the air-aether towards `F` or towards `G`, which is 2,000-3,000 times more distant. They can perhaps draw more than 60 circles. 

This is why:
- the farthest planets move more slowly than those nearest to the sun
- all the planets together move more slowly than the comets, which are more distant.


## The Sizes of the Air-Aether Particles Depend on their Location

- Between the edges of `FFFFGG` and edges of the circle `KK`, the air-aether has similar sizes, with those at the edges of `FFFFGG` being slightly smaller than those at the edges of circle `KK` <!-- (provided that the difference of their sizes are not proportionately greater than that of their speeds) -->.
- By contrast, from circle `K` to the `sun`, the air-aether nearest to the sun are the smallest and strongest due to their agitation.
 
The smaller their size, the faster their speed.
- Otherwise, if were large and fast, then they would be flung out to the edges of circle `KK` 

<!-- they were inversely proportional, then they would go out to occupy the place of the farthest. -->

{{< img src="/graphics/physics/orbitalspeed.jpg" alt="Orbital Speeds" >}}

<!-- The difference of their sizes is proportional to their speeds.  -->
<!-- tely greater than (or at least proportionately as great as) that of their speeds.  -->

<!-- Note finally that, given the manner in which I have said the sun and the other fixed stars were formed,  -->

The sizes of the stars can be so small with respect to their stellar gravitational territories. This makes the circles `KK`, `LL`, etc mark the edges of the agitated area of these stars which facilitates the smaller particles of the air-aether. 
- These circles can be considered as the center of those stellar gravitational territories.
