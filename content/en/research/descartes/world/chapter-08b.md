## Spacetime Becomes Electromagnetism

The matter that came out from around the parts of the aethereal air were broken and had the small points of their angles dulled from rounding off. These necessarily had to go faster than the aethereal air. 

Along with it came a facility for dividing and changing shape at every moment in order to accommodate itself to the shape of the places where it is. 

**Thus, it took the form of the aethereal fire.**

It went faster because it had to go off to the side through very narrow passages and out of the small spaces left between the parts of the air-aether as they collided head-on. It had much more of a path than the air-aether to traverse in the same time.

The excess fire-aether needed to fill the small gaps in the round air-aether. These necessarily go around them and must draw back toward the centers around the air-aether. 
<!-- which those parts turn, -->

This is because the air-aether occupies all the other, more distant places. 
<!-- parts of the second] -->

At those centers, the remaining <!-- first element --> fire-aether must compose perfectly liquid and subtle round bodies. 


## The Inverse Square Law Comes From Circular Motion

These incessantly turn much faster than, and in the same direction as, the parts of air-aether surrounding them. 

The parts of the fire-aether have the force:
- to increase the agitation of those parts to which they are closest and
- in moving from the center toward the circumference, to push the parts of fire-aether in all directions, just as they push one another.

This action we perceive as light. 

<!-- We shall take one of those round bodies composed purely of the  -->
<!-- matter of the first element  -->

Assume a round body of pure fire aether to be the sun, and the others to be the fixed stars. 
<!-- , of the new world I am describing to you.  -->

The air-aether turns around them as heliospheres ['the heavens'].
 <!--  [spacetime]. -->
<!-- We shall take the matter of the -->
<!-- second element -->

Imagine, that:
- the points `sun`, `barnard`, `sirius`, and `alphacentauri` are the centers
- all the air-aether of the space `FGGF` is a heliosphere turning around the `sun`
- all the air-aether of the space `HGGH` is another heliosphere turning around the star `alphacentauri`, and so on for the others. 

**Thus, there are as many aethereal heliospheres as there are stars.** 
- Since the number of stars is indefinite, so too is the number of heliospheres. 

**The firmament is the breadthless surface separating all the heliospheres from one another.**

The parts of the air-aether towards `F` or `G` are more agitated than those toward `K` or `L`.

In this way, the speed of the air-aether decreases little by little from the outside edges of each heliosphere towards their center area such as:
- the sphere `KK` around the `sun`
- the sphere `LL` around `alphacentauri`. 

It then increases little by little from there to the centers of the heliospheres because of the agitation of the stars at the center. 

Thus, the air-aether towards `K` draws there a complete circle around the `sun`.

Those towards `earth`, which is 10 times closer to the sun, have not only the chance to describe 10 circles (as they would do if they moved only equally fast), but perhaps more than 30.[42]

Again, the air-aether towards `F` or towards `G`, which is 2,000-3,000 times more distant, can perhaps draw more than 60 circles. 

This is why:
- the farthest planets move more slowly than those nearest to the sun
- all the planets together move more slowly than the comets, which are more distant.

The size of each of the parts of the aethereal air is equal among all those between the outside circumference `FGGF` of the heliosphere and the circle `KK`.

The farthest among them are a bit smaller than the nearest (provided that one does not suppose the difference of their sizes to be proportionately greater than that of their speeds). 

By contrast, from circle `K` to the `sun`, the nearest air-aether are the smallest, and also the strongest due to their agitation.

The difference of their sizes is proportional to their speeds. If they were inversely proportional, then they would go out to occupy the place of the farthest.
<!-- tely greater than (or at least proportionately as great as) that of their speeds.  -->

<!-- Note finally that, given the manner in which I have said the sun and the other fixed stars were formed,  -->

The sizes of the stars can be so small with respect to the heliospheres containing them. 

The circles `KK`, `LL`, etc. mark the point where the agitation of their stars  speeds up the path of the air-aether.
- Even these circles are merely points that mark the heliospheres' center.

<!-- In the same way, the new astronomers consider the whole sphere of Saturn as but a point in comparison with the firmament. -->
