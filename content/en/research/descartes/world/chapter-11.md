What is the weight of this physical Earth? 

The weight of the Earth is caused by the force that unites all its parts and makes them all tend toward its center, according to their:
- size and
- solidity.

This force is made up of the air-aether of the planetary gravitational territory surrounding it. 
- This external air-aether rotates faster than the air-aether inside the Earth.  

The air-aether of this planetary gravitational territory  surrounding the earth-aether turns much faster than its parts around its center. This causes them to move away from its center with more force. 

As a consequence of this outward movement, the faster external air-aether pushes the earth-aether back toward its center [to fill the air-aether that goes away from the center].


In previous chapters, I said that:
- the most massive and solid bodies, such as comets, tend to move outward towards the edges of the stellar gravitational territory. 
- the less massive and less solid ones are pushed back toward the centers of the territory. 

But this assumes that they were already moving with the same agitation as the air-aether of that stellar gravitational territory. 

It does not follow that:
- the less solid parts of the earth-aether could be pushed back towards its center.
- the more solid ones should move away from the center. 

In reality, the earth-aether would be pushed towards the center where the air-aether were turning if:
- the earth-aether were not moving
- the earth-aether moved slower than what is required* to follow the air-aether 

> *Superphysics Note: This is the escape velocity. 



**The air-aether will push the earth-aether with more force and speed the larger and more solid the earth-aether is.** 

Nevertheless, the earth-aether in comets can move towards the exterior of the stellar gravitational territory.
- This is because they gained speed by going towards the center of the solar system. 
- This will give them enough force to pass beyond the exterior upon their exit


The earth `EFGH` and its  water `1234` and air `5678` are a single mass.
- Its water and air are composed of the less solid of the earth's parts.

The air-aether fills:
- all the space between the circles `ABCD` and `5678`, and
- all the small intervals below it among the parts of the air, the water, and the earth.

This air-aether and the Earth turn together around center `T`.

All their parts tend to move away from that center. 
- The air-aether outside of Earth moves away faster than the air-aether within the Earth because the former are much more agitated.
- Likewise, the parts of the Earth that are more agitated in the same direction as those of the planetary gravitational territory tend more to move away from the center than the less agitated.

"Void" here means the space that is filled only with pure aether that could not resist the actions of other bodies nor produce any considerable effect.

If the whole space beyond circle `ABCD` were a void, then all the parts within the circle `ABCD` would be the first to leave it. 
- It would be followed by those of the air
- It would then be followed by those of the water
- Finally it would be followed by those of the earth

Each of them would follow much sooner as it were less attached to the rest of its mass.[51] 

<!-- In the same way:
- a stone leaves a sling in which it is being moved as soon as one releases the cord
- the dust one throws on a top while it is turning immediately flies off from it in all directions. -->


## Gravitational Equilibrium

There is no void beyond circle `ABCD`.

This means that the air-aether inside it has nowhere external to go to unless the external air-aether goes in simultaneously.

<!-- 
d and where the parts of the heaven contained within that circle can go, unless at the same instant others completely like them enter in their place, 
 parts of the earth -->

Similarly, the earth-aether also cannot move away any farther from center `T` unless air-aether or earth-aether descend in their place.

 <!-- just as many parts of the heaven or other terrestrial parts as are needed to fill it.  -->
They also cannot move closer to the center unless just as many others move out from the center to be replaced. 
 <!-- rise in their stead.  -->

Thus, they are all opposed to one another. 

Each opposes:
- those that must enter in its place in the case that it should rise, and
- those that must enter therein in the case that it should descend

This is similar to how the 2 sides of a balance are opposed to one another. 

One side of a balance can be raised or lowered only if the other side does exactly the contrary at the same instant.


The heavier side of the balance always raises the lighter side.
