How can the air-aether between the lines `AF` and `DG` go all together towards `E` when the distance between `A` and `D` is greater than that between `F` and `G`? 
- This makes them enter a narrower space than where they came from.

{{< img src="/graphics/physics/world-13hhh.jpg" alt="Black Hole" cap="" >}}

This is because their motion going out of the the center `S` does not affect the air-aether on their sides.
- It only affects those that are in front of them [those farther from `S`].
- Those in front then affect those in their front, and so on. 

When they move away from the center, they do not touch their neighbors that are at the same distance from that center. 
- They only touch those that are a bit more distant from that center.

An example is the balls below. 

{{< img src="/graphics/physics/descartes07.jpg" alt="Balls" cap="" >}}

The weight of the small ball:
- `1` does not make it exert a force of `10`
- `2` does not make it exert a force of `20`.
- `3` does not make it exert a force of `30`.
- `4` does not make it exert a force of `40`.

Instead, they only force:
- ball `1` to rest on `2`
- ball `10` to rest on `20`
- and so on.
  
Thus, these small balls can be arranged in many other ways. 

The air-aether moves separately from one another. They can never be arranged like the balls above. 


## Galaxy Arms and Accretion Disks

Nonetheless, it is only in that mode [of arrangement] that the proposed difficulty manifests itself. 

{{< img src="/graphics/physics/world-13hhh.jpg" alt="Black Hole" cap="" >}}

<!-- For one could not suppose between those of its parts that are the same distance from the center of their territory an interval so small that it would not suffice to conceive  -->

Their inclination to move away from `S` causes those between the lines `AF` and `DG` to advance all together towards `E` when `E` is void. 


Thus, the weight of the small balls 40, 30, etc. causes them to fall all together toward the space `50` as soon as `50` can leave it.
 <!-- you see in Figure 9, compared with Figure 10, that  -->

{{< img src="/graphics/physics/descartes09.jpg" alt="Balls Falling" cap="" >}}

This makes them enter a narrower space and consequently to move closer to one another.

<!-- The balls that are marked with the same numeral are arranged in a space narrower than that which they leave, that is, by moving  -->

The two `40` balls fall a bit faster, and move proportionately a bit closer to one another, than the three `30` balls. 
- These three must move faster and closer to one another than the four `20` balls, and so on.

The two `40` balls might come to touch one another after having fallen slightly. This makes them stop falling. 

 <!-- (which is why they stop without being able to fall lower).  -->

In the very same way, the air-aether that advances toward `E` will stop before filling that whole space.
- But they cannot advance toward `E` the slightest bit since the whole space is already filled by some body (whatever it might be).
- And so they press continually on that body and make an effort against it as if to chase it out of its place.[59]

<!-- without it being enough to prove perfectly that  -->


{{< img src="/graphics/physics/vortex.jpg" alt="Supermassive Black Hole" cap="A possible explanation for the photon ring is the temporary stoppage of the air-aether particles from going out by the sheer density of the vortex. This stoppage creates friction which produces electromagnetism [fire-aether] from spacetime [air-aether]." >}}

Their other motions continue in them while they thus advance towards `E`. These:
- change their arrangement, and
- impede them from touching one another.
  - Rather, it causes them, upon touching, to immediately to separate again.

Thus, they continue to advance uninterruptedly towards the space `E`, until it is completely filled. 

**The conclusion is that the force that causes them to go towards `E` is vibratory in nature**.
- As the particles change position, it increases or relaxes those diverse small vibrations. 
- This is a property suited to light.


## The Gravitational Pull of a Star or Galaxy Comes From the Differences in the Air-Aethers

We have assumed that the spaces `E` and `S` and all the small angles between the air-aether are empty.

Now, fill them with the fire-aether. 

{{< img src="/graphics/physics/world-13hhh.jpg" alt="Black Hole" cap="The gravitational pull of a star or galaxy comes from the smaller-air aether going back to the center to replace the larger air-aether going out that creates the circular pattern. No dark matter is needed as the cause is the difference in the size and force of the invisible spacetime particles" >}}

The fire-aether in space `E` cannot stop the air-aether between the lines `AF` and `DG` from advancing to fill `E` up.
- This is because that fire-aether is already extremely subtle and agitated.
- They are always ready to leave the places where they are in.
 <!-- as any other body might be to enter them. -->

This is why the fire-aether at `E` gives up its place to the air-aether at `E` going to `S`.
- That smaller air-aether goes to `S` to replace the larger air-aether that go out of `S`.

 <!-- air-aether parts of the aethreal fire that occupies the small angles between the parts of the heaven cede their place without resistance to those coming from that space E and tending to go toward the point `S`.  -->

<!-- The other bodies are more united and larger and so have more force.  all tend to move away from it. -->

The smaller air-aether go from `E` toward `S` between the larger air-aether that go from `S` towards `E` without impeding each other.

This similar to how the physical air in the sandclock `XYZ` rises from `Z` towards `X` through the sand `Y` while that sand falls towards `Z`.

{{< img src="/graphics/physics/sandclock.png" alt="Sandclock" cap="In Cartesian Physics, gravity is the effort of Nature to keep the equilibrium between invisible spacetime particles. We use this in Superphysics to find the ideal ratio that will lead to stability between identities and remove their agitation and attain the natural state. We call this ratio as an elastic band. We apply this principle in Social Superphysics to keep marriages stable, and decrease the political and economic instability in societies, for example. " >}}


The fire-aether in the space `ABCD`:
- composes the body of the sun
- there turns very rapidly in a circle around `S`

These tend to move away from it in all directions in a straight line. 
- All those in line `SD` together push the air-aether particles at point `D`
- All those in line `SA` push that which is at point `A`, and so on.

This alone can cause all the air-aether between the lines `AF` and `DG` to advance towards the space `E`, even though they might have no inclination themselves to do so.

They thus must advance towards space `E` when it is occupied only by the fire-aether. 
- They also tend to go there even though it is filled by some other body.

Consequently, they push and make an effort against that body as if to drive it out of its place. 

**Thus, if a man's eye were at the point `E`, then it would actually be pushed**, both:
- by the sun and
- by all the air-aether between the lines `AF` and `DG`.

Such aethereal men would see light when their eyes are pushed in this way, just as we do.

<!-- The men of this new world will be of such a nature that, when their eyes are pushed in this manner, they will have from it a sensation very much like that which we have of light. -->
