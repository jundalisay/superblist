Bodies that revolve always tend to move away from the centers that they revolve from. <!--  of the circles they describe.  --> But what direction do the stars and heavens tend towards?

<!-- Here, however, I must determine more specifically in what directions the parts of the matter of which the heavens and the stars are composed do tend.[54] -->


## Cartesian Inertia as Inherent Motion 

A body that 'tends' towards some direction does not mean that there is a thought or desire inside the body that carries it there. Instead, it means that:

- It is **disposed** to move there and
- There is something <!-- , whether it truly moves or, rather, some other body --> **preventing** it. <!-- It is principally in this last sense that I use the word "tend," because it seems to signify some effort and because -->

'Tend' here means that the body is doing an effort to counteract such a <!-- resis  presupposes some --> resistance. 

**The body thus tends towards different directions at the same time**

<!-- [according to different points of view.] -->

There are often diverse causes that act together on the same body. 
- These impede each other's effect.
- The same body can be thought of as tending in different directions at the same time. 


## Centrifugal and Centripetal Forces

Similarly, parts of the Earth:

1. **moves towards the center** when they pushed to the center by the external [invisible spacetime particles] air-aether

For example, the stone curving in a sling along the circle `AB` would tend circularly from `A` to `B`, if the cord remained and **its length** regulated and determined the stone's motion.

2. **moves away from the center** when they are considered as a separate identity from that center.

<!-- ,alone  or when compared to more massive parts -->

The same stone will tend towards `C` from point `A` if the cord uniting it to the center disappeared. 

<!-- it were agitated alone [and ]. -->

3. **moves away from the center** when considered less massive than the other more massive parts [have more difference from the center-identity]

The stone would tend towards `E` if the circular agitation was ignored and it broke free from the sling's force. 

<!-- its energy were totally not affected or impeded by the sling.  -->

<!-- 2. **They move closer to its center** when one considers the force of the air-aether pushing them there*

> *Superphysics note: This means that centripetal forces have their origin outside of the identity. In this case, material centripetal forces is from the external spacetime exerting a force on the body. This is different from centrifugal forces which are inherent.  

In Superphysics, this is the Law of Conservation of Idea applied to the Material Layer. Cartesian inertia and the creation of centrifugal forces therefore have their origin on that law

### Superphysics Note:

It follows that centripetal force is from:
- the unity of 2 identities 
- the external force to unite them

Centrifugal force is from:
- the difference between 2 identities
- the internal force to separate them

In Hinduism and Taoism, centrifugal forces are from the Negative Force or Shakti or Yin, while centripetal is from the Positive Force or Shiva or Yang. 

In education, this is why external pressure has to be applied to learners who do not want to learn a certain topic. But this pressure is not needed when the topic is something that learners can easily and naturally identify with.

Therefore, parents should ask their children what topics they are naturally interested in, instead of forcing topics that they cannot identify with

## Why Do Bodies Move Away From the Center?

To understand why the body leaves the center, imagine that the inclination of this stone to move from `A` toward `C` were composed of 2 other inclinations:

1. Circular inclination along the circle `AB`
2. Repelling inclination along the line `DY`


{{< img src="/graphics/physics/world-13ddd.jpg" cap="In Cartesian Physics, 'Centrifugal Force' is a result of " alt="Centrifugal Force" >}}


<!-- ### 3. Inertia from the Background Influence of Other Bodies -->


<!-- `VXY` -->

Imagine the inclinations were in the following ratios:

Position of Sling | Position of Stone
--- | ---
A | A
B | C
F | G

![1](/graphics/physics/world-13eee.jpg)


Thus, the 2 inclinations together make the stone always move along line `ACG`.

 <!-- a proportion that, if the stone were at the place of the sling marked `A` `V`  when the sling was at the place of the circle marked `A`, it should thereafter be at the place marked X when the sling is at B, and at the place marked Y when the sling is at `F`, and thus should always remain in the straight line `ACG`.  -->

<!-- - Then, knowing that one of the parts of its inclination (to wit, that which carries it along the circle AB) is in no way impeded by the sling, you will easily see that the stone meets resistance only for the other part (to wit, for that which would cause it to move along the line `DVXY` if it were not impeded).  -->


<!-- ### 2. Inertia Without the Influence from a Second Body -->

If there were no sling, the stone, with the agitation that would move it along the circle `AB`, would move along the path `DXY`.

<!-- - Then, knowing that one of the parts of its inclination (to wit, that which carries it along the circle AB) is in no way impeded by the sling, you will easily see that the stone meets resistance only for the other part (to wit, for that which would cause it to move along the line `DVXY` if it were not impeded).  -->

<!-- ### 1. Inertia Without Influence -->

From this point of view, the stone at `A` tends (makes an effort) only to move directly away from the center `D` and towards `E`.
- It is not at all more disposed to move toward `H` than toward `I`.

We can easily make a mistake and think that the stone would move either to `H` or `I` if we forgot the difference between:
- the motion that it already has going away from `D` and
 <!-- [unaffected by other bodies not D] and  -->
- its inherent inclination to move  
<!-- that remains with it [from D]. -->

<!-- 1. Straight line movement away (Law Conservation Idea)
2. Circular movement from gravity based on sling of 2nd object
3. Straying movement from Background influence   -->
<!-- alone [wit


## Spacetime Expansion

This stone is similar to the aetheral air that compose the heavens.
<!-- - The aethereal air that are at `E` tend of their own inclination only towards `P`. -->

The air-aether [invisible spacetime particles] should be thought of as being the same as this stone `R`.

{{< img src="/graphics/physics/world-11.jpg" cap="In Cartesian Physics, the revolution of invisible spacetime particles around the Earth causes the tides and its oblate spheroid shape" alt="The gravitational territory of the Earth" >}}

Those that are at `E` tend of their own inclination towards `P`.
<!-- Those that are at `E` tend of their own inclination toward `P`. -->

<!-- ![Black Holes](/graphics/physics/world-13fff.jpg) -->

- But the resistance of the other air-aether particles above them cause them to move along the circle `ER`.
  - This resistance is opposed to their inclination to move in a straight line. 
- This resistance when alone would make them move towards `M` which is the near the center `T`.

This is how they go towards the places that are directly opposite the center `T` of their gravitational territory.
