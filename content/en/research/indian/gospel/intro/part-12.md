In March 1875, about a year before the death of his mother, the Master met Keshab Chandra Sen, a worthy representative of modern India.

Keshab was the leader of the Brāhmo Samāj, one of the two great movements that, during the latter part of the 19th century, played an important part in shaping the
course of the renascence of India. 

The Brāhmo movement was founded in 1828 by the great Rājā Rāmmohan Roy (1774-1833). He was born in an orthodox brāhmin family. But he showed great sympathy for Islam and Christianity. 

He had gone to Tibet in search of the Buddhist mysteries. He had extracted from Christianity its ethical system, but had rejected the divinity of Christ as he had denied the Hindu Incarnations. 

Islam influenced him, to a great extent, in the formulation of his monotheistic doctrines. But he always went back to the Vedas for his spiritual inspiration. 

The Brāhmo Samāj was dedicated to the "worship and adoration of the Eternal, the Unsearchable, the Immutable Being, who is
the Author and Preserver of the Universe". 

The Samāj was open to all without distinction of colour, creed, caste, nation, or religion.

The real organizer of the Samāj was Devendranāth Tāgore (1817-1905), the father of the poet Rabindranāth. His physical and spiritual beauty, aristocratic aloofness, penetrating intellect, and poetic sensibility made him the foremost leader of the educated Bengālis. 

These addressed him by the respectful epithet of Maharshi, the "Great Seer". 

The Maharshi was a Sanskrit scholar and, unlike Rājā Rāmmohan Roy, drew his inspiration entirely from the Upanishads. He was an implacable enemy of image worship and also fought to stop the infiltration of Christian ideas into the Samāj. 

He gave the movement its faith and ritual. Under his influence the Brāhmo Samāj professed One Self-existent Supreme Being who had created the universe out of nothing, the God of Truth, Infinite Wisdom, Goodness, and Power, the Eternal and Omnipotent, the One without a Second. Man should love Him and do His will, believe in Him and worship Him,
and thus merit salvation in the world to come. 

By far the ablest leader of the Brāhmo movement was Keshab Chandra Sen (1838-1884). Unlike Rājā Rāmmohan Roy and Devendranāth Tāgore, Keshab was born of a middle-class Bengāli family and had been brought up in an English school. 

He did not know Sanskrit and very soon broke away from the popular Hindu religion. Even at an early age he came under the spell of Christ and professed to have experienced the special favour of John the Baptist, Christ, and St. Paul. When he strove to introduce Christ to the Brāhmo Samāj, a rupture became inevitable with Devendranāth. 

In 1868, Keshab broke with the older leader and founded the Brāhmo Samāj of India, Devendra retaining leadership of the first Brāhmo Samāj, now called the Ādi Samāj. Keshab had a complex nature. When passing through a great moral crisis, he
spent much of his time in solitude and felt that he heard the voice of God.

When a devotional form of worship was introduced into the Brāhmo Samāj, he spent hours in
singing kirtan with his followers. He visited England in 1870 and impressed the English
people with his musical voice, his simple English, and his spiritual fervour. He was entertained by Queen Victoria.

Returning to India, he founded centres of the Brāhmo Samāj in various parts of the country. Not unlike a professor of comparative religion in a European university, he began to discover, about the time of his first contact with Sri Ramakrishna, the harmony of religions. 

He became sympathetic toward the Hindu gods and goddesses, explaining them in a liberal fashion. Further, he believed that he was called by God to dictate to the world God's newly revealed law, the New Dispensation,
the Nava-vidhān.

In 1878, a schism divided Keshab's Samāj. Some of his influential followers accused him of infringing the Brāhmo principles by marrying his daughter to a wealthy man before she had attained the marriageable age approved by the Samāj. This group seceded and established the Sādhāran Brāhmo Samāj, Keshab remaining the leader of the Navavidhān. 

Keshab now began to be drawn more and more toward the Christ ideal, though under the influence of Sri Ramakrishna his devotion to the Divine Mother also deepened. His mental oscillation between Christ and the Divine Mother of Hinduism found no position of rest. 

In Bengāl and some other parts of India the Brāhmo movement took the form of Unitarian Christianity, scoffed at Hindu rituals, and preached a crusade against image worship. Influenced by Western culture, it declared the supremacy of reason, advocated the ideals of the French Revolution, abolished the caste-system among, its own members, stood for the emancipation of women, agitate for the abolition of early marriage, sanctioned the remarriage of widows, and encouraged various educational and social-reform movements. 

The immediate effect of the Brāhmo movement in Bengāl was the checking of the proselytising activities of the Christian missionaries. It also raised Indian culture in the estimation of its English masters. But it was an intellectual and eclectic religious ferment born of the necessity of the time. Unlike Hinduism, it was not founded on the deep inner experiences of sages and prophets. 

Its influence was confined to a comparatively few educated men and women of the country, and the vast masses of the Hindus remained outside it. It sounded monotonously only one of the notes in the rich gamut of the Eternal Religion of the Hindus.

## Ārya Samāj

The other movement playing an important part in the nineteenth-century religious
revival of India was the Ārya Samāj. 

The Brāhmo Samāj was a movement of compromise with European culture, tacitly admitting the superiority of the West.

But the founder of the Ārya Samāj was a pugnacious Hindu sannyāsi who accepted the challenge of Islam and Christianity and was resolved to combat all foreign influence in India.

Swāmi Dayānanda (1824-1883) was a great scholar of the Vedas, which he explained as being strictly monotheistic. He launched this movement in Bombay in 1875. Soon, its influence was felt throughout western India.

He:
- preached against the worship of images
- re-established the ancient Vedic sacrificial rites
- decreed that the Vedas were the ultimate authority on religion
  - He accepted every word of them as literally true. 

The Ārya Samāj became a bulwark against the encroachments of Islam and Christianity. Its orthodox flavour appealed to many Hindu minds. 

It:
- led many movements of social reform
- attacked the caste-system
- liberated women from many of their social disabilities
- greatly encouraged education
- was against early marriage
- advocated the remarriage of Hindu widows

Its influence was strongest in the Punjab, the battleground of the Hindu and Islamic cultures.

A new fighting attitude was introduced into the slumbering Hindu society. Unlike the Brāhmo Samāj, the influence of
the Ārya Samāj was not confined to the intellectuals. It spread to the masses.

It was a dogmatic movement intolerant of those disagreed with its views, and it emphasized only one way, the Ārya Samāj way, to the realization of Truth. Sri Ramakrishna met Swāmi Dayānanda when the latter visited Bengāl.


## Keshab Chandra Sen

Keshab Chandra Sen and Sri Ramakrishna met for the first time in the garden house of Jaygopāl Sen at Belgharia, a few miles from Dakshineśwar, where the great Brāhmo leader was staying with some of his disciples.

In many respects, the two were poles apart, though an irresistible inner attraction was to make them intimate friends. The
Master had realized God as Pure Spirit and Consciousness, but he believed in the various forms of God as well.

Keshab, on the other hand, regarded image worship as idolatry and gave allegorical explanations of the Hindu deities. Keshab was an orator and a writer of books and magazine articles; Sri Ramakrishna had a horror of lecturing and hardly 54knew how to write his own name. 

Keshab's was famous locally and also in England. The Master still led a secluded life in the village of Dakshineśwar. Keshab emphasized social reforms for India's regeneration; to Sri Ramakrishna God-realization was the only goal of life. 

Keshab considered himself a disciple of Christ and accepted in a diluted form the Christian sacraments and Trinity; Sri
Ramakrishna was the simple child of Kāli, the Divine Mother, though he too, in a different way, acknowledged Christ's divinity. 

Keshab was a house-holder and took a real interest in the welfare of his children, whereas Sri Ramakrishna was a paramahamsa and completely indifferent to the life of the world. Yet, as their acquaintance ripened into friendship, Sri Ramakrishna and Keshab held each other in great love and respect. 

Years later, at the news of Keshab's death, the Master felt as if half his body had become paralysed. Keshab's concepts of the harmony of religions and the Motherhood of God were deepened and enriched by his contact with Sri Ramakrishna.

Sri Ramakrishna, dressed in a red-bordered dhoti, one end of which was carelessly thrown over his left shoulder, came to Jaygopal's garden house accompanied by Hriday.

No one took notice of the unostentatious visitor. Finally the Master said to Keshab, "People tell me you have seen God; so I have come to hear from you about God." 

A magnificent conversation followed. The Master sang a thrilling song about Kāli and forthwith went into Samādhi. When Hriday uttered the sacred "Om" in his ears, he gradually came back to consciousness of the world, his face still radiating a divine brilliance. Keshab and his followers were amazed. The contrast between Sri Ramakrishna
and the Brāhmo devotees was very interesting. 

There sat this small man, thin and extremely delicate. His eyes were illumined with an inner light. Good humour gleamed in his eyes and lurked in the corners of his mouth. His speech was Bengāli of a homely kind with a slight, delightful stammer, and his words held men enthralled by their wealth of spiritual experience, their inexhaustible store of simile and metaphor, their power of observation, their bright and subtle humour, their wonderful catholicity, their ceaseless flow of wisdom. And around him now were the sophisticated men of Bengāl, the best products of Western education, with Keshab, the idol of young Bengāl, as their leader.

Keshab's sincerity was enough for Sri Ramakrishna. Henceforth the two saw each other frequently, either at Dakshineśwar or at the temple of the Brāhmo Samāj. Whenever the Master was in the temple at the time of divine service, Keshab would request him to speak to the congregation. And Keshab would visit the saint, in his turn, with offerings of
flowers and fruits.

## Other Brāhmo Leaders

Gradually other Brāhmo leaders began to feel Sri Ramakrishna's influence. But they were by no means uncritical admirers of the Master. They particularly disapproved of his ascetic renunciation and condemnation of, "woman and gold".7 They measured him according to their own ideals of the householder's life. Some could not understand his Samādhi and described it as a nervous malady. Yet they could not resist his magnetic personality.

Among the Brāhmo leaders who knew the Master closely were Pratāp Chandra Mazumdār, Vijay Krishna Goswāmi, Trailokyanāth Sannyāl and Śivanāth Śastri. 

Śivanāth, one day, was greatly impressed by the Master's utter simplicity and abhorrence of praise. He was seated with Sri Ramakrishna in the latter's room when several rich men of Calcutta arrived. The Master left the room for a few minutes. In the mean time Hriday, his nephew, began to describe his Samādhi to the visitors. 

The last few words caught the Master's ear as he entered the room. He said to Hriday: "What a mean-spirited fellow you must be to extol me thus before these rich men! You have seen their costly apparel and their gold watches and chains, and your object is to get from them as much money as you can. What do I care about what they think of me? (Turning
to the gentlemen) No, my friends, what he has told you about me is not true. It was not
love of God that made me absorbed in God and indifferent to external life. I became
positively insane for some time. The sādhus who frequented this temple told me to
practise many things. 

I tried to follow them, and the consequence was that my austerities drove me to insanity." This is a quotation from one of Śivanāth's books. He took the Master's words literally and failed to see their real import.
Śivanāth vehemently criticized the Master for his other-worldly attitude toward his wife.
He writes: "Ramakrishna was practically separated from his wife, who lived in her village
home. One day when I was complaining to some friends about the virtual widowhood of
his wife, he drew me to one side and whispered in my ear: 'Why do you complain? It is
no longer possible; it is all dead and gone.' Another day as I was inveighing against this
part of his teaching, and also declaring that our program of work in the Brāhmo Samāj
includes women, that ours is a social and domestic religion, and that we want to give
education and social liberty to women, the saint became very much excited, as was his
way when anything against his settled conviction was asserted - a trait we so much liked
in him - and exclaimed, 'Go, thou fool, go and perish in the pit that your women will dig
for you.' Then he glared at me and said: 'What does a gardener do with a young plant?
Does he not surround it with a fence, to protect it from goats and cattle? And when the
young plant has grown up into a tree and it can no longer be injured by cattle, does he
not remove the fence and let the tree grow freely?' I replied, 'Yes, that is the custom
with gardeners.' Then he remarked, 'Do the same in your spiritual life; become strong,
be full-grown; then you may seek them.' To which I replied, 'I don't agree with you in
thinking that women's work is like that of cattle, destructive; they are our associates and
helpers in our spiritual struggles and social progress' - a view with which he could not
agree, and he marked his dissent by shaking his head. Then referring to the lateness of
the hour he jocularly remarked, 'It is time for you to depart; take care, do not be late;
otherwise your woman will not admit you into her room.' This evoked hearty laughter."
Pratāp Chandra Mazumdār, the right-hand man of Keshab and an accomplished Brāhmo
preacher in Europe and America, bitterly criticized Sri Ramakrishna's use of uncultured
language and also his austere attitude toward his wife. But he could not escape the spell
of the Master's personality. In the course of an article about Sri Ramakrishna, Pratāp
wrote in the "Theistic Quarterly Review": "What is there in common between him and
me? I, a Europeanized, civilized, self-centered, semi-sceptical, so-called educated
56reasoner, and he, a poor, illiterate, unpolished, half-idolatrous, friendless Hindu devotee?
Why should I sit long hours to attend to him, I, who have listened to Disraeli and
Fawcett, Stanley and Max Muller, and a whole host of European scholars and divines? …
And it is not I only, but dozens like me, who do the same. … He worships Śiva, he
worships Kāli, he worships Rāmā, he worships Krishna, and is a confirmed advocate of
Vedāntic doctrines. … He is an idolater, yet is a faithful and most devoted Meditator on
the perfections of the One Formless, Absolute, Infinite Deity. … His religion is ecstasy,
his worship means transcendental insight, his whole nature burns day and night with a
permanent fire and fever of a strange faith and feeling. … So long as he is spared to us,
gladly shall we sit at his feet to learn from him the sublime precepts of purity,
unworldliness, spirituality, and inebriation in the love of God. … He, by his childlike
bhakti, by his strong conceptions of an ever-ready Motherhood, helped to unfold it [God
as our Mother] in our minds wonderfully. … By associating with him we learnt to realize better the divine attributes as scattered over the 330 millions of deities of mythological India, the gods of the Purānās."

The Brāhmo leaders received much inspiration from their contact with Sri Ramakrishna.

It broadened their religious views and kindled in their hearts the yearning for God-realization; it made them understand and appreciate the rituals and symbols of Hindu
religion, convinced them of the manifestation of God in diverse forms, and deepened
their thoughts about the harmony of religions. The Master, too, was impressed by the
sincerity of many of the, Brāhmo devotees. He told them about his own realizations and
explained to them the essence of his teachings, such as the necessity of renunciation,
sincerity in the pursuit of one's own course of discipline, faith in God, the performance of
one's duties without thought of results, and discrimination between the Real and the
unreal.
This contact with the educated and progressive Bengālis opened Sri Ramakrishna's eyes
to a new realm of thought. Born and brought up in a simple village, without any formal
education, and taught by the orthodox holy men of India in religious life, he had had no
opportunity to study the influence of modernism on the thoughts and lives of the Hindus.
He could not properly estimate the result of the impact of Western education on Indian
culture. He was a Hindu of the Hindus, renunciation being to him the only means to the
realization of God in life. From the Brahmos he learnt that the new generation of India
made a compromise between God and the world. Educated young men were influenced
more by the Western philosophers than by their own prophets. But Sri Ramakrishna was
not dismayed, for he saw in this, too, the hand of God. And though he expounded to the
Brahmos all his ideas about God and austere religious disciplines, yet he bade them
accept from his teachings only as much as suited their tastes and temperaments.
