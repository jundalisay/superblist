---


According to the Tantra, the Ultimate Reality is Chit, or Consciousness, which is identical
with Sat, or Being, and with Ānanda, or Bliss. 

This Ultimate Reality, Satchidānanda, Existence-Knowledge-Bliss Absolute, is identical with the Reality preached in the Vedas.

Man is identical with this Reality; but under the influence of Māyā, or illusion, he has forgotten his true nature. He takes to be real a merely apparent world of subject and object, and this error is the cause of his bondage and suffering. 

The goal of spiritual discipline is the rediscovery of his true identity with the divine Reality.

For the achievement of this goal the Vedānta prescribes an austere negative method of discrimination and renunciation, which can be followed by only a few individuals endowed with sharp intelligence and unshakeable will-power. But Tantra takes into consideration the natural weakness of human beings, their lower appetites, and their love for the concrete. It combines philosophy with rituals, meditation with ceremonies, renunciation with enjoyment. The underlying purpose is gradually to train the aspirant to meditate on his identity with the Ultimate.

The average man wishes to enjoy the material objects of the world. Tantra bids him enjoy these, but at the same time, discover in them the presence of God. Mystical rites are prescribed by which, slowly, the sense objects become spiritualized and sense attraction is transformed into a love of God. So the very "bonds" of man are turned into "releasers". 

The very poison that kills is transmuted into the elixir of life. Outward renunciation is not necessary. Thus, the aim of Tantra is to sublimate Bhoga, or enjoyment, into Yoga, or union with Consciousness. For, according to this philosophy,
the world with all its manifestations is nothing but the sport of Śiva and Śakti, the
Absolute and Its inscrutable Power.

The disciplines of Tantra are graded to suit aspirants of all degrees. Exercises are prescribed for people with "animal", "heroic", and "divine" outlooks. Certain of the rites require the presence of members of the opposite sex. Here the aspirant learns to look on woman as the embodiment of the Goddess Kāli, the Mother of the Universe. 

The very basis of Tantra is the Motherhood of God and the glorification of woman. Every part of a woman's body is to be regarded as incarnate Divinity. But the rites are extremely dangerous. The help of a qualified guru is absolutely necessary. An unwary devotee may lose his foothold and fall into a pit of depravity.

According to the Tantra, Śakti is the active creative force in the universe. Śiva, the Absolute, is a more or less passive principle. Further, Śakti is as inseparable from Śiva as fire's power to burn is from fire itself. Śakti, the Creative Power, contains in Its womb the universe, and therefore is the Divine Mother. All women are Her symbols. Kāli is one of Her several forms. 

The meditation on Kāli, the Creative Power, is the central discipline of the Tantra. While meditating, the aspirant at first regards himself as one with the Absolute and then thinks that out of that Impersonal Consciousness emerge two entities,
namely, his own self and the living form of the Goddess. He then projects the Goddess
into the tangible image before him and worships it as the Divine Mother.

Sri Ramakrishna set himself to the task of practising the disciplines of Tantra; and at the bidding of the Divine Mother Herself he accepted the Brāhmani as his guru. He performed profound and delicate ceremonies in the Panchavati and under the bel-tree at the northern extremity of the temple compound. He practised all the disciplines of the 64 principal Tantra books, and it took him never more than three days to achieve the result promised in any one of them. After the observance of a few preliminary rites, he would be overwhelmed with a strange divine fervour and would go into Samādhi,
where his mind would dwell in exaltation. Evil ceased to exist for him. The word "carnal"
lost its meaning. 

The whole world and everything in it appeared as the Lila, the sport, of Śiva and Śakti. He beheld everywhere manifest the power and beauty of the Mother, the whole world, animate and inanimate, appeared to him as pervaded with Chit,
Consciousness, and with Ānanda, Bliss.

He saw in a vision the Ultimate Cause of the universe as a huge luminous triangle giving birth every moment to an infinite number of worlds. He heard the Anāhata Śabda, the great sound Om, of which the innumerable sounds of the universe are only so many echoes. 

He acquired the 8 supernatural powers of Yoga, which make a man almost omnipotent, and these he spurned as of no value whatsoever to the Spirit. He had a vision of the divine Māyā, the inscrutable Power of God, by which the universe is created and sustained, and into which it is finally absorbed. In this vision he saw a woman of exquisite beauty, about to become a mother, emerging from the Ganges and slowly approaching the Panchavati. 
 
Presently she gave birth to a child and began to nurse it tenderly. A moment later she assumed a terrible aspect, seized the child with her grim jaws and crushed it.

Swallowing it, she re-entered the waters of the Ganges. But the most remarkable experience during this period was the awakening of the Kundalini Śakti, the "Serpent Power". He actually saw the Power, at first lying asleep at the bottom of the spinal column, then waking up and ascending along the mystic Sushumna canal and through its six centres, or lotuses, to the Sahasrāra, the thousand-petalled lotus in the top of the head. He further saw that as the Kundalini went upward
the different lotuses bloomed.

This phenomenon was accompanied by visions and trances. Later on he described to his disciples and devotees the various movements of the Kundalini: the fishlike, birdlike, monkey like, and so on. The awakening of the
Kundalini is the beginning of spiritual consciousness, and its union with Śiva in the
Sahasrāra, ending in Samādhi, is the consummation of the Tāntrik disciplines.

<!-- About this time it was revealed to him that in a short while many devotees would seek his guidance. -->

## Vaishnava Disciplines

After completing the Tāntrik sādhana Sri Ramakrishna followed the Brāhmani in the disciplines of Vaishnavism. The Vaishnavas are worshippers of Vishnu, the "All-pervading", the Supreme God, who is also known as Hari and Nārāyana. Of Vishnu's
various Incarnations the two with the largest number of followers are Rāmā and Krishna.
Vaishnavism is exclusively a religion of bhakti. Bhakti is intense love of God, attachment
to Him alone; it is of the nature of bliss and bestows upon the lover immortality and
liberation. God, according to Vaishnavism, cannot be realized through logic or reason;
and, without bhakti, all penances, austerities, and rites are futile. Man cannot realize
God by self-exertion alone. For the vision of God His grace is absolutely necessary, and
this grace is felt by the pure of heart.

The mind is to be purified through bhakti. The pure mind then remains for ever immersed in the ecstasy of God-vision. It is the cultivation of this divine love that is the chief concern of the Vaishnava religion.

There are three kinds of formal devotion: tāmasic, rājasic, and sāttvic. If a person, while showing devotion to God, is actuated by malevolence, arrogance, jealousy, or anger, then his devotion is tāmasic, since it is influenced by tamas, the quality of inertia. 

If he worships God from a desire for fame or wealth, or from any other worldly ambition, then his devotion is rājasic, since it is influenced by rajas, the quality of activity. But if a person loves God without any thought of material gain, if he performs his duties to please God alone and maintains toward all created beings the attitude of friendship, then his devotion is called sāttvic, since it is influenced by sattva, the quality of harmony. 

But the highest devotion transcends the three gunās, or qualities, being a spontaneous, uninterrupted inclination of the mind toward God, the Inner Soul of all beings; and it wells up in the heart of a true devotee as soon as he hears the name of God or mention of God's attributes. 

A devotee possessed of this love would not accept the happiness of
heaven if it were offered him. His one desire is to love God under all conditions - in
pleasure and pain, life and death, honour and dishonour, prosperity and adversity.
There are two stages of bhakti. The first is known as Vaidhi–Bhakti, or love of God
qualified by scriptural injunctions. For the devotees of this stage are prescribed regular
and methodical worship, hymns, prayers, the repetition of God's name, and the chanting
of His glories. This lower bhakti in course of time matures into Parā–Bhakti, or supreme
devotion, known also as Prema, the most intense form of divine love. Divine love is an
end in itself. It exists potentially in all human hearts, but in the case of bound creatures
it is misdirected to earthly objects.
To develop the devotee's love for God, Vaishnavism humanises God. God is to be
regarded as the devotee's Parent, Master, Friend, Child, Husband, or Sweetheart, each
succeeding relationship representing an intensification of love. These Bhāvās, or attitudes
toward God, are known as Śānta, Dāsya, Sakhya, Vātsalya, and Madhur. The rishis of
the Vedās, Hanumān, the cowherd boys of Vrindāvan, Rāmā's mother Kausalya, and
Rādhika, Krishna's sweetheart, exhibited, respectively, the most perfect examples of
these forms. In the ascending scale the glories of God are gradually forgotten and the
devotee realizes more and more the intimacy of divine communion. Finally he regards
himself as the mistress of his Beloved, and no artificial barrier remains to separate him
from his Ideal. No social or moral obligation can bind to the earth his soaring spirit. He
experiences perfect union with the Godhead. Unlike the Vedantist, who strives to
transcend all varieties of the subject-object relationship, a devotee of the Vaishnava
path wishes to retain both his own individuality and the personality of God. To him God
is not an intangible Absolute, but the Purushottama, the Supreme Person.
While practising the discipline of the Madhur Bhāva, the male devotee often regards
himself as a woman, in order to develop the most intense form of love for Sri Krishna,
the only Purusha, or man, in the universe. This assumption of the attitude of the
opposite sex has a deep psychological significance. It is a matter of common experience
that an idea may be cultivated to such an intense degree that every idea alien to it is
driven from the mind. This peculiarity of the mind may he utilised for the subjugation of
the lower desires and the development of the spiritual nature. Now, the idea which is the
basis of all desires and passions in a man is the conviction of his indissoluble association
with a male body. If he can inoculate himself thoroughly with the idea that he is a
woman, he can get rid of the desires peculiar to his male body. Again, the idea that he is
a woman may in turn be made to give way to another higher idea, namely, that he is
neither man nor woman, but the Impersonal Spirit. The Impersonal Spirit alone can
enjoy real communion with the Impersonal God. Hence the highest realization of the
Vaishnava draws close to the transcendental experience of the Vedantist.
A beautiful expression of the Vaishnava worship of God through love is to be found in the
Vrindāvan episode of the Bhāgavata. The gopis, or milk-maids, of Vrindāvan regarded
the six-year-old Krishna as their Beloved. They sought no personal gain or happiness
from this love. They surrendered to Krishna their bodies, minds, and souls. Of all the
36gopis, Rādhika, or Rādhā, because of her intense love for Him, was the closest to
Krishna. She manifested Mahā–bhāva and was united with her Beloved. This union
represents, through sensuous language, a supersensuous experience.
Sri Chaitanya, also known as Gaurānga, Gorā, or Nimāi, born in Bengāl in 1485 and
regarded as an Incarnation of God, is a great prophet of the Vaishnava religion.
Chaitanya declared the chanting of God's name to be the most efficacious spiritual
discipline for the Kali–Yuga.
Sri Ramakrishna, as the monkey Hanumān, had already worshipped God as his Master.
Through his devotion to Kāli he had worshipped God as his Mother. He was now to take
up the other relationships prescribed by the Vaishnava scriptures.
