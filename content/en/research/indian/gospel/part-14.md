The Master's Yearning for His Own Devotees


Contact with the Brahmos increased Sri Ramakrishna's longing to encounter aspirants
who would be able to follow his teachings in their purest form. "There was no limit", he
once declared, "to the longing I felt at that time. During the day-time I somehow
managed to control it. The secular talk of the worldly-minded was galling to me, and I
would look wistfully to the day when my own beloved companions would come. I hoped
57to find solace in conversing with them and relating to them my own realizations. Every
little incident would remind me of them, and thoughts of them wholly engrossed me. I
was already arranging in my mind what I should say to one and give to another, and so
on. But when the day would come to a close I would not be able to curb my feelings. The
thought that another day had gone by, and they had not come, oppressed me. When,
during the evening service, the temples rang with the sound of bells and conch-shells, I
would climb to the roof of the Kuthi in the garden and, writhing in anguish of heart, cry
at the top of my voice: 'Come, my children! Oh, where are you? I cannot bear to live
without you.' A mother never longed so intensely for the sight of her child, nor a friend
for his companions, nor a lover for his sweetheart, as I longed for them. Oh, it was
indescribable! Shortly after this period of yearning the devotees began to come."
In the year 1879 occasional writings about Sri Ramakrishna by the Brahmos, in the
Brāhmo magazines, began to attract his future disciples from the educated middle-class
Bengālis, and they continued to come till 1884. But others, too, came, feeling the subtle
power of his attraction. They were an ever shifting crowd of people of all castes and
creeds: Hindus and Brahmos, Vaishnavas and Śāktās, the educated with university
degrees and the illiterate, old and young, maharajas and beggars, journalists and artists,
pundits and devotees, philosophers and the worldly-minded, jnānis and yogis, men of
action and men of faith, virtuous women and prostitutes, office-holders and vagabonds,
philanthropists and self-seekers, dramatists and drunkards, builders-up and pullers-
down. He gave to them all, without stint, from his illimitable store of realization. No one
went away empty-handed. He taught them the lofty knowledge of the Vedānta and the
soul-melting love of the Purānā. Twenty hours out of twenty-four he would speak
without rest or respite. He gave to all his sympathy and enlightenment, and he touched
them with that strange power of the soul which could not but melt even the most
hardened. And people understood him according to their powers of comprehension.
The Master's Method of Teaching
But he remained as ever the willing instrument in the hand of God, the child of the
Divine Mother, totally untouched by the idea of being a teacher. He used to say that
three ideas - that he was a guru, a father, and a master - pricked his flesh like thorns.
Yet he was an extraordinary teacher. He stirred his disciples' hearts more by a subtle
influence than by actions or words. He never claimed to be the founder of a religion or
the organizer of a sect. Yet he was a religious dynamo. He was the verifier of all religions
and creeds. He was like an expert gardener, who prepares the soil and removes the
weeds, knowing that the plants will grow because of the inherent power of the seeds,
producing each its appropriate flowers and fruits. He never thrust his ideas on anybody.
He understood people's limitations and worked on the principle that what is good for one
may be bad for another. He had the unusual power of knowing the devotees' minds,
even their inmost souls, at the first sight. He accepted disciples with the full knowledge
of their past tendencies and future possibilities. The life of evil did not frighten him, nor
did religious squeamishness raise anybody in his estimation. He saw in everything the
unerring finger of the Divine Mother. Even the light that leads astray was to him the light
from God.
58To those who became his intimate disciples the Master was a friend, companion, and
playmate. Even the chores of religious discipline would be lightened in his presence. The
devotees would be so inebriated with pure joy in his company that they would have no
time to ask themselves whether he was an Incarnation, a perfect soul, or a yogi. His
very presence was a great teaching; words were superfluous. In later years his disciples
remarked that while they were with him they would regard him as a comrade, but
afterwards would tremble to think of their frivolities in the presence of such a great
person. They had convincing proof that the Master could, by his mere wish, kindle in
their hearts the love of God and give them His vision.
Through all this fun and frolic, this merriment and frivolity, he always kept before them
the shining ideal of God-Consciousness and the path of renunciation. He prescribed
ascents steep or graded according to the powers of the climber. He permitted no
compromise with the basic principles of purity. An aspirant had to keep his body, mind,
senses, and soul unspotted; had to have a sincere love for God and an ever mounting
spirit of yearning. The rest would be done by the Mother.
His disciples were of two kinds: the householders, and the young men, some of whom
were later to become monks. There was also a small group of women devotees.
House Holder Devotees
For the householders Sri Ramakrishna did not prescribe the hard path of total
renunciation. He wanted them to discharge their obligations to their families. Their
renunciation was to be mental. Spiritual life could not he acquired by flying away from
responsibilities. A married couple should live like brother and sister after the birth of one
or two children, devoting their time to spiritual talk and contemplation. He encouraged
the householders, saying that their life was, in a way, easier than that of the monk,
since it was more advantageous to fight the enemy from inside a fortress than in an
open field. He insisted, however, on their repairing into solitude every now and then to
strengthen their devotion and faith in God through prayer, japa, and meditation. He
prescribed for them the companionship of sādhus . He asked them to perform their
worldly duties with one hand, while holding to God with the other, and to pray to God to
make their duties fewer and fewer so that in the end they might cling to Him with both
hands. He would discourage in both the householders and the celibate youths any
lukewarmness in their spiritual struggles. He would not ask them to follow
indiscriminately the ideal of non-resistance, which ultimately makes a coward of the
unwary.
Future Monks
But to the young men destined to be monks he pointed out the steep path of
renunciation, both external and internal. They must take the vow of absolute continence
and eschew all thought of greed and lust. By the practice of continence, aspirants
develop a subtle nerve through which they understand the deeper mysteries of God. For
them self-control is final, imperative, and absolute. The sannyāsis are teachers of men,
and their lives should be totally free from blemish. They must not even look at a picture
which may awaken their animal passions. The Master selected his future monks from
59young men untouched by "woman and gold" and plastic enough to be cast in his spiritual
mould. When teaching them the path of renunciation and discrimination, he would not
allow the householders to be any where near them.
Rām and Manomohan
The first two householder devotees to come to Dakshineśwar were Rām Chandra Dutta
and Manomohan Mitra. A medical practitioner and chemist, Rām was sceptical about God
and religion and never enjoyed peace of soul. He wanted tangible proof of God's
existence. The Master said to him: "God really exists. You don't see the stars in the day-
time, but that doesn't mean that the stars do not exist. There is butter in milk. But can
anybody see it by merely looking at the milk? To get butter you must churn milk in a
quiet and cool place. You cannot realize God by a mere wish; you must go through some
mental disciplines." By degrees the Master awakened Rām's spirituality and the latter
became one of his foremost lay disciples. It was Rām who introduced Narendranāth to
Sri Ramakrishna. Narendra was a relative of Rām.
Manomohan at first met with considerable opposition from his wife and other relatives,
who resented his visits to Dakshineśwar. But in the end the unselfish love of the Master
triumphed over worldly affection. It was Manomohan who brought Rākhāl to the Master.
Surendra
Suresh Mitra, a beloved disciple whom the Master often addressed as Surendra, had
received an English education and held an important post in an English firm. Like many
other educated young men of the time, he prided himself on his atheism and led a
Bohemian life. He was addicted to drinking. He cherished an exaggerated notion about
man's free will. A victim of mental depression, he was brought to Sri Ramakrishna by
Rāmchandra Dutta. When he heard the Master asking a disciple to practise the virtue of
self-surrender to God, he was impressed. But though he tried thenceforth to do so, he
was unable to give up his old associates and his drinking. One day the Master said in his
presence, "Well, when a man goes to an undesirable place, why doesn't he take the
Divine Mother with him?" And to Surendra himself Sri Ramakrishna said: "Why should
you drink wine as wine? Offer it to Kāli, and then take it as Her Prasād, as consecrated
drink. But see that you don't, become intoxicated; you must not reel and your thoughts
must not wander. At first you will feel ordinary excitement, but soon you will experience
spiritual exaltation." Gradually Surendra's entire life was changed. The Master
designated him as one of those commissioned by the Divine Mother to defray a great
part of his expenses. Surendra's purse was always open for the Master's comfort.
Kedār
Kedarnāth Chatterji was endowed with a spiritual temperament and had tried various
paths of religion, some not very commendable. When he met the Master at
Dakshineśwar he understood the true meaning of religion. It is said that the Master,
weary of instructing devotees who were coming to him in great numbers for guidance,
once prayed to the Goddess Kāli: "Mother, I am tired of speaking to people. Please give
power to Kedār, Girish, Rām, Vijay, and Mahendra to give them the preliminary
instruction, so that just a little teaching from me will be enough." He was aware,
60however, of Kedār's lingering attachment to worldly things and often warned him about
it.
Harish
Harish, a young man in affluent circumstances, renounced his family and took shelter
with the Master, who loved him for his sincerity, singleness of purpose, and quiet nature.
He spent his leisure time in prayer and meditation, turning a deaf ear to the entreaties
and threats of his relatives. Referring to his undisturbed peace of mind, the Master would
say: "Real men are dead to the world though, living. Look at Harish. He is an example."
When one day the Master asked him to be a little kind to his wife, Harish said: "You
must excuse me on this point. This is not the place to show kindness. If I try to be
sympathetic to her, there is a possibility of my forgetting the ideal and becoming
entangled in the world."
Bhavanāth
Bhavanāth Chatterji visited the Master while he was still in his teens. His parents and
relatives regarded Sri Ramakrishna as an insane person and tried their utmost to
prevent him from becoming intimate with the Master. But the young boy was very
stubborn and often spent nights at Dakshineśwar. He was greatly attached to Narendra,
and the Master encouraged their friendship. The very sight of him often awakened Sri
Ramakrishna's spiritual emotion.
Balarām Bose
Balarām Bose came of a wealthy Vaishnava family. From his youth he had shown a deep
religious temperament and had devoted his time to meditation, prayer, and the study of
the Vaishnava scriptures. He was very much impressed by Sri Ramakrishna even at their
first meeting. He asked Sri Ramakrishna whether God really existed and, if so, whether a
man could realize Him. The Master said: "God reveals Himself to the devotee who thinks
of Him as his nearest and dearest. Because you do not draw response by praying to Him
once, you must not conclude that He does not exist. Pray to God, thinking of Him as
dearer than your very self. He is much attached to His devotees. He comes to a man
even before He is sought. There is none more intimate and affectionate than God."
Balarām had never before heard God spoken of in such forceful words; every one of the
words seemed true to him. Under the Master's influence he outgrew the conventions of
the Vaishnava worship and became one of the most beloved of the disciples. It was at
his home that the Master slept whenever he spent a night in Calcutta.
Mahendra or M.
Mahendranāth Gupta, known as "M.", arrived at Dakshineśwar in February 1882. He
belonged to the Brāhmo Samāj and was headmaster of the Vidyāsāgar High School at
Śyāmbazār, Calcutta. At the very first sight the Master recognized him as one of his
"marked" disciples. Mahendra recorded in his diary Sri Ramakrishna's conversations with
his devotees. These are the first directly recorded words, in the spiritual history of the
world, of a man recognized as belonging in the class of Buddha and Christ. The present
volume is a translation of this diary. Mahendra was instrumental, through his personal
contacts, in spreading the Master's message among many young and aspiring souls.
61Nāg Mahāshay
Durgācharan Nāg, also known as Nāg Mahāshay, was the ideal householder among the
lay disciples of Sri Ramakrishna. He was the embodiment of the Master's ideal of life in
the world, unstained by worldliness. In spite of his intense desire to become a sannyāsi,
Sri Ramakrishna asked him to live in the world in the spirit of a monk, and the disciple
truly carried out this injunction. He was born of a poor family and even during his
boyhood often sacrificed everything to lessen the sufferings of the needy. He had
married at an early age and after his wife's death had married a second time to obey his
father's command. But he once said to his wife: "Love on the physical level never lasts.
He is indeed blessed who can give his love to God with his whole heart. Even a little
attachment to the body endures for several births. So do not be attached to this cage of
bone and flesh. Take shelter at the feet of the Mother and think of Her alone. Thus your
life here and hereafter will he ennobled." The Master spoke of him as a "blazing light".
He received every word of Sri Ramakrishna in dead earnest. One day he heard the
Master saying that it was difficult for doctors, lawyers, and brokers to make much
progress in spirituality. Of doctors he said, "If the mind clings to the tiny drops of
medicine, how can it conceive of the Infinite?" That was the end of Durgācharan's
medical practice and he threw his chest of medicines into the Ganges. Sri Ramakrishna
assured him that he would not lack simple food and clothing. He bade him serve holy
men. On being asked where he would find real holy men, the Master said that the sādhus
themselves would seek his company. No sannyāsi could have lived a more austere life
than Durgācharan.
Girish Ghosh
Girish Chandra Ghosh was a born rebel against God, a sceptic, a Bohemian, a drunkard.
He was the greatest Bengāli dramatist of his time, the father of the modern Bengāli
stage. Like other young men he had imbibed all the vices of the West. He had plunged
into a life of dissipation and had become convinced that religion was only a fraud.
Materialistic philosophy he justified as enabling one to get at least a little fun out of life.
But a series of reverses shocked him and he became eager to solve the riddle of life. He
had heard people say that in spiritual life the help of a guru was imperative and that the
guru was to be regarded as God Himself. But Girish was too well acquainted with human
nature to see perfection in a man. His first meeting with Sri Ramakrishna did not impress
him at all. He returned home feeling as if he had seen a freak at a circus; for the Master,
in a semi-conscious mood, had inquired whether it was evening, though the lamps were
burning in the room. But their paths often crossed, and Girish could not avoid further
encounters. The Master attended a performance in Girish's Star Theatre. On this
occasion, too, Girish found nothing impressive about him. One day, however, Girish
happened to see the Master dancing and singing with the devotees. He felt the contagion
and wanted to join them, but restrained himself for fear of ridicule. Another day Sri
Ramakrishna was about to give him spiritual instruction, when Girish said: "I don't want
to listen to instructions. I have myself written many instructions. They are of no use to
me. Please help me in a more tangible way if you can." This pleased the Master and he
asked Girish to cultivate faith.
62As time passed, Girish began to learn that the guru is the one who silently unfolds the
disciple's inner life. He became a steadfast devotee of the Master.
He often loaded the Master with insults, drank in his presence, and took liberties which
astounded the other devotees. But the Master knew that at heart Girish was tender,
faithful, and sincere. He would not allow Girish to give up the theatre. And when a
devotee asked him to tell Girish to give up drinking, he sternly replied: "That is none of
your business. He who has taken charge of him will look after him. Girish is a devotee of
heroic type. I tell you, drinking will not affect him." The Master knew that mere words
could not induce a man to break deep-rooted habits, but that the silent influence of love
worked miracles. Therefore he never asked him to give up alcohol, with the result that
Girish himself eventually broke the habit. Sri Ramakrishna had strengthened Girish's
resolution by allowing him to feel that he was absolutely free.
One day Girish felt depressed because he was unable to submit to any routine of
spiritual discipline. In an exalted mood the Master said to him: "All right, give me your
power of attorney. Henceforth I assume responsibility for you. You need not do
anything." Girish heaved a sigh of relief. He felt happy to think that Sri Ramakrishna had
assumed his spiritual responsibilities. But poor Girish could not then realize that he also,
on his part, had to give up his freedom and make of himself a puppet in Sri
Ramakrishna's hands. The Master began to discipline him according to this new attitude.
One day Girish said about a trifling matter, "Yes, I shall do this." "No, no!" the Master
corrected him. "You must not speak in that egotistic manner. You should say, 'God
willing, I shall do it'." Girish understood. Thenceforth he tried to give up all idea of
personal responsibility and surrender himself to the Divine Will. His mind began to dwell
constantly on Sri Ramakrishna. This unconscious meditation in time chastened his
turbulent spirit.
The householder devotees generally visited Sri Ramakrishna on Sunday afternoons and
other holidays. Thus a brotherhood was gradually formed, and the Master encouraged
their fraternal feeling. Now and then he would accept an invitation to a devotee's home,
where other devotees would also be invited. Kirtan would be arranged and they would
spend hours in dance and devotional music. The Master would go into trances or open
his heart in religious discourses and in the narration of his own spiritual experiences.
Many people who could not go to Dakshineśwar participated in these meetings and felt
blessed. Such an occasion would be concluded with a sumptuous feast.
But it was in the company of his younger devotees, pure souls yet unstained by the
touch of worldliness, that Sri Ramakrishna took greatest joy. Among the young men who
later embraced the householder's life were Nārāyan, Paltu, the younger Naren,
Tejchandra and Purna. These visited the Master sometimes against strong opposition
from home.
Purna
Purna was a lad of thirteen, whom Sri Ramakrishna described as an Iśvarakoti, a soul
born with special spiritual qualities. The Master said that Purna was the last of the group
63of brilliant devotees who, as he once had seen in a trance, would come to him for
spiritual illumination. Purna said to Sri Ramakrishna during their second meeting, "You
are God Himself incarnated in flesh and blood." Such words coming from a mere
youngster proved of what stuff the boy was made.
Mahimācharan and Pratāp Hazra
Mahimācharan and Pratāp Hazra were two devotees outstanding for their
pretentiousness and idiosyncrasies. But the Master showed them his unfailing love and
kindness, though he was aware of their shortcomings. Mahimācharan Chakravarty had
met the Master long before the arrival of the other disciples. He had had the intention of
leading a spiritual life, but a strong desire to acquire name and fame was his weakness.
He claimed to have been initiated by Totāpuri and used to say that he had been following
the path of knowledge according to his guru's instructions. He possessed a large library
of English and Sanskrit books. But though he pretended to have read them, most of the
leaves were uncut. The Master knew all his limitations, yet enjoyed listening to him
recite from the Vedas and other scriptures. He would always exhort Mahimā to meditate
on the meaning of the scriptural texts and to practise spiritual discipline.
Pratāp Hazra, a middle-aged man, hailed from a village near Kāmārpukur. He was not
altogether unresponsive to religious feelings. On a moment's impulse he had left his
home, aged mother, wife, and children, and had found shelter in the temple garden at
Dakshineśwar, where he intended to lead a spiritual life. He loved to argue, and the
Master often pointed him out as an example of barren argumentation. He was
hypercritical of others and cherished an exaggerated notion of his own spiritual
advancement. He was mischievous and often tried to upset the minds of the Master's
young disciples, criticizing them for their happy and joyous life and asking them to
devote their time to meditation. The Master teasingly compared Hazra to Jatila and
Kutila, the two women who always created obstructions in Krishna's sport with the gopis,
and said that Hazra lived at Dakshineśwar to "thicken the plot" by adding complications.
Some noted Men
Sri Ramakrishna also became acquainted with a number of people whose scholarship or
wealth entitled them everywhere to respect. He had met, a few years before,
Devendranāth Tāgore, famous all over Bengāl for his wealth, scholarship, saintly
character, and social position. But the Master found him disappointing; for, whereas Sri
Ramakrishna expected of a saint complete renunciation of the world, Devendranāth
combined with his saintliness a life of enjoyment. Sri Ramakrishna met the great poet
Michael Madhusudan, who had embraced Christianity "for the sake of his stomach". To
him the Master could not impart instruction, for the Divine Mother "pressed his tongue".
In addition he met Mahārāja Jatindra Mohan Tāgore, a titled aristocrat of Bengāl;
Kristodās Pāl, the editor, social reformer, and patriot; Iswar Chandra Vidyāsāgar,
the noted philanthropist and educator; Pundit Śaśadhar, a great champion of Hindu
orthodoxy; Aświni Kumār Dutta, a headmaster, moralist, and leader of Indian
Nationalism; and Bankim Chatterji, a deputy magistrate, novelist, and essayist, and
one of the fashioners of modern Bengāli prose. Sri Ramakrishna was not the man to be
dazzled by outward show, glory, or eloquence. A pundit without discrimination he
64regarded as a mere straw. He would search people's hearts for the light of God, and if
that was missing, he would have nothing to do with them.
Kristodās Pāl
The Europeanized Kristodās Pāl did not approve of the Master's emphasis on
renunciation and said: "Sir, this cant of renunciation has almost ruined the country. It is
for this reason that the Indians are a subject nation today. Doing good to others,
bringing education to the door of the ignorant, and above all, improving the material
conditions of the country - these should be our duty now. The cry of religion and
renunciation would, on the contrary, only weaken us. You should advise the young men
of Bengāl to resort only to such acts as will uplift the country." Sri Ramakrishna gave
him a searching look and found no divine light within. "You man of poor understanding!"
Sri Ramakrishna said sharply. "You dare to slight in these terms renunciation and piety,
which our scriptures describe as the greatest of all virtues! After reading two pages of
English you think you have come to know the world! You appear to think you are
omniscient. Well, have you seen those tiny crabs that are born in the Ganges just when
the rains set in? In this big universe you are even less significant than one of those small
creatures. How dare you talk of helping the world? The Lord will look to that. You haven't
the power in you to do it." After a pause the Master continued: "Can you explain to me
how you can work for others? I know what you mean by helping them. To feed a number
of persons, to treat them when they are sick, to construct a road or dig a well - Isn't that
all? These are good deeds, no doubt, but how trifling in comparison with the vastness of
the universe! How far can a man advance in this line? How many people can you save
from famine? Malaria has ruined a whole province; what could you do to stop its
onslaught? God alone looks after the world. Let a man first realize Him. Let a man get
the authority from God and be endowed with His power; then, and then alone, may he
think of doing good to others. A man should first be purged of all egotism. Then alone
will the Blissful Mother ask him to work for the world." Sri Ramakrishna mistrusted
philanthropy that presumed to pose as charity. He warned people against it. He saw in
most acts of philanthropy nothing but egotism, vanity, a desire for glory, a barren
excitement to kill the boredom of life, or an attempt to soothe a guilty conscience. True
charity, he taught, is the result of love of God - service to man in a spirit of worship.
Monastic Disciples
The disciples whom the Master trained for monastic life were the following:
1. Narendranāth Dutta (Swāmi Vivekānanda)
2. Nitya Niranjan Sen (Swāmi Niranjanānanda)
3. Rākhāl Chandra Ghosh (Swāmi Brahmānanda)
4. Kāliprasād Chandra (Swāmi Abhedānanda)
5. Gopāl Chandra Ghosh (Swāmi Advaitānanda)
6. Harināth Chattopādhyāya (Swāmi Turiyānanda)
7. Bāburām Ghosh (Swāmi Premānanda)
8. Sāradā Prasanna (Swāmi Trigunātitānanda)
9. Tāraknāth Ghoshāl (Swāmi Shivānanda)
10. Gangādhar Ghatak (Swāmi Akhandānanda)
11. Jogindranāth Choudhury (Swāmi Yogānanda)
6512. Subodh Ghosh (Swāmi Subodhānanda)
13. Śashibhushan Chakravarty (Swāmi Rāmakrishnānanda)
14. Śaratchandra Chakravarty (Swāmi Sāradānanda)
15. Hariprasanna Chatterji (Swāmi Vijnānānanda)
16. Lātu (Swāmi Adhhutānanda)
Lātu
The first of these young men to come to the Master was Lātu. Born of obscure parents,
in Behar, he came to Calcutta in search of work and was engaged by Rāmchandra Dutta
as house-boy. Learning of the saintly Sri Ramakrishna, he visited the Master at
Dakshineśwar and was deeply touched by his cordiality. When he was about to leave, the
Master asked him to take some money and return home in a boat or carriage. But Lātu
declared he had a few pennies and jingled the coins in his pocket. Sri Ramakrishna later
requested Rām to allow Lātu to stay with him permanently. Under Sri Ramakrishna's
guidance Lātu made great progress in meditation and was blessed with ecstatic visions,
but all the efforts of the Master to give him a smattering of education failed. Lātu was
very fond of kirtan and other devotional songs but remained all his life illiterate.
Rākhāl
Even before Rākhāl's coming to Dakshineśwar, the Master had had visions of him as his
spiritual son and as a playmate of Krishna at Vrindāvan. Rākhāl was born of wealthy
parents. During his childhood he developed wonderful spiritual traits and used to play at
worshipping gods and goddesses. In his teens he was married to a sister of Manomohan
Mitra, from whom he first heard of the Master. His father objected to his association with
Sri Ramakrishna but afterwards was reassured to find that many celebrated people were
visitors at Dakshineśwar. The relationship between the Master and this beloved disciple
was that of mother and child. Sri Ramakrishna allowed Rākhāl many liberties denied to
others. But he would not hesitate to chastise the boy for improper actions. At one time
Rākhāl felt a childlike jealousy because he found that other boys were receiving the
Master's affection. He soon got over it and realized his guru as the Guru of the whole
universe. The Master was worried to hear of his marriage, but was relieved to find that
his wife was a spiritual soul who would not be a hindrance to his progress.
The Elder Gopāl
Gopāl Chandra Ghosh came to Dakshineśwar at a rather advanced age and was called
the elder Gopāl. He had lost his wife, and the Master assuaged his grief. Soon he
renounced the world and devoted himself fully to meditation and prayer. Some years
later Gopāl gave the Master the ochre cloths with which the latter initiated several of his
disciples into monastic life.
Narendra
To spread his message to the four corners of the earth Sri Ramakrishna needed a strong
instrument. With his frail body and delicate limbs he could not make great journeys
across wide spaces. And such an instrument was found in Narendranāth Dutta, his
beloved Naren, later known to the world as Swāmi Vivekānanda. Even before meeting
Narendranāth, the Master had seen him in a vision as a sage, immersed in the
66meditation of the Absolute, who at Sri Ramakrishna's request had agreed to take human
birth to assist him in his work.
Narendra was born in Calcutta on January 12, 1863, of an aristocratic Kāyastha family.
His mother was steeped in the great Hindu epics, and his father, a distinguished attorney
of the Calcutta High Court, was an agnostic about religion, a friend of the poor, and a
mocker at social conventions. Even in his boyhood and youth Narendra possessed great
physical courage and presence of mind, a vivid imagination, deep power of thought,
keen intelligence, an extraordinary memory, a love of truth, a passion for purity, a spirit
of independence, and a tender heart. An expert musician, he also acquired proficiency in
physics, astronomy, mathematics, philosophy, history, and literature. He grew up into an
extremely handsome young man. Even as a child he practised meditation and showed
great power of concentration. Though free and passionate in word and action, he took
the vow of austere religious chastity and never allowed the fire of purity to be
extinguished by the slightest defilement of body or soul.
As he read in college the rationalistic Western philosophers of the nineteenth century, his
boyhood faith in God and religion was unsettled. He would not accept religion on mere
faith; he wanted demonstration of God. But very soon his passionate nature discovered
that mere Universal Reason was cold and bloodless. His emotional nature, dissatisfied
with a mere abstraction, required a concrete support to help him in the hours of
temptation. He wanted an external power, a guru, who by embodying perfection in the
flesh would still the commotion of his soul. Attracted by the magnetic personality of
Keshab, he joined the Brāhmo Samāj and became a singer in its choir. But in the Samāj
he did not find the guru who could say that he had seen God.
In a state of mental conflict and torture of soul, Narendra came to Sri Ramakrishna at
Dakshineśwar. He was then eighteen years of age and had been in college two years. He
entered the Master's room accompanied by some light-hearted friends. At Sri
Ramakrishna's request he sang a few songs, pouring his whole soul into them, and the
Master went into Samādhi. A few minutes later Sri Ramakrishna suddenly left his seat,
took Narendra by the hand, and led him to the screened verandah north of his room.
They were alone. Addressing Narendra most tenderly, as if he were a friend of long
acquaintance, the Master said: "Ah! You have come very late. Why have you been so
unkind as to make me wait all these days? My ears are tired of hearing the futile words
of worldly men. Oh, how I have longed to pour my spirit into the heart of someone fitted
to receive my message!" He talked thus, sobbing all the time. Then, standing before
Narendra with folded hands, he addressed him as Nārāyana, born on earth to remove
the misery of humanity. Grasping Narendra's hand, he asked him to come again, alone,
and very soon. Narendra was startled. "What is this I have come to see?" he said to
himself. "He must be stark mad. Why, I am the son of Viswanāth Dutta. How dare he
speak this way to me?"
When they returned to the room and Narendra heard the Master speaking to others, he
was surprised to find in his words an inner logic, a striking sincerity, and a convincing
proof of his spiritual nature. In answer to Narendra's question, "Sir, have you seen
67God?" the Master said: "Yes, I have seen God. I have seen Him more tangibly than I see
you. I have talked to Him more intimately than I am talking to you." Continuing, the
Master said: "But, my child, who wants to see God? People shed jugs of tears for money,
wife, and children. But if they would weep for God for only one day they would surely
see Him." Narendra was amazed. These words he could not doubt. This was the first
time he had ever heard a man saying that he had seen God. But he could not reconcile
these words of the Master with the scene that had taken place on the verandah only a
few minutes before. He concluded that Sri Ramakrishna was a monomaniac, and
returned home rather puzzled in mind.
During his second visit, about a month later, suddenly, at the touch of the Master,
Narendra felt overwhelmed and saw the walls of the room and everything around him
whirling and vanishing. "What are you doing to me?" he cried in terror. "I have my father
and mother at home." He saw his own ego and the whole universe almost swallowed in a
nameless void. With a laugh the Master easily restored him. Narendra thought he might
have been hypnotized, but he could not understand how a monomaniac could cast a
spell over the mind of a strong person like himself. He returned home more confused
than ever, resolved to be henceforth on his guard before this strange man.
But during his third visit Narendra fared no better. This time, at the Master's touch, he
lost consciousness entirely. While he was still in that state, Sri Ramakrishna questioned
him concerning his spiritual antecedents and whereabouts, his mission in this world, and
the duration of his mortal life. The answers confirmed what the Master himself had
known and inferred. Among other things, he came to know that Narendra was a sage
who had already attained perfection, and that the day he learnt his real nature he would
give up his body in yoga, by an act of will.
A few more meetings completely removed from Narendra's mind the last traces of the
notion that Sri Ramakrishna might be a monomaniac or wily hypnotist. His integrity,
purity, renunciation, and unselfishness were beyond question. But Narendra could not
accept a man, an imperfect mortal, as his guru. As a member of the Brāhmo Samāj, he
could not believe that a human intermediary was necessary between man and God.
Moreover, he openly laughed at Sri Ramakrishna's visions as hallucinations. Yet in the
secret chamber of his heart he bore a great love for the Master.
Sri Ramakrishna was grateful to the Divine Mother for sending him one who doubted his
own realizations. Often he asked Narendra to test him as the money-changers test their
coins. He laughed at Narendra's biting criticism of his spiritual experiences and Samādhi.
When at times Narendra's sharp words distressed him, the Divine Mother Herself would
console him, saying: "Why do you listen to him? In a few days he will believe your every
word." He could hardly bear Narendra's absences. Often he would weep bitterly for the
sight of him. Sometimes Narendra would find the Master's love embarrassing; and one
day he sharply scolded him, warning him that such infatuation would soon draw him
down to the level of its object. The Master was distressed and prayed to the Divine
Mother. Then he said to Narendra: "You rogue, I won't listen to you any more. Mother
68says that I love you because I see God in you, and the day I no longer see God in you I
shall not be able to bear even the sight of you."
The Master wanted to train Narendra in the teachings of the non-dualistic Vedānta
philosophy. But Narendra, because of his Brāhmo upbringing, considered it wholly
blasphemous to look on man as one with his Creator. One day at the temple garden he
laughingly said to a friend: "How silly! This jug is God! This cup is God! Whatever we see
is God! And we too are God! Nothing could be more absurd." Sri Ramakrishna came out
of his room and gently touched him. Spellbound, he immediately perceived that
everything in the world was indeed God. A new universe opened around him. Returning
home in a dazed state, he found there too that the food, the plate, the eater himself, the
people around him, were all God. When he walked in the street, he saw that the cabs,
the horses, the streams of people, the buildings, were all Brahman. He could hardly go
about his day's business. His parents became anxious about him and thought him ill. And
when the intensity of the experience abated a little, he saw the world as a dream.
Walking in the public square, he would strike his head against the iron railings to know
whether they were real. It took him a number of days to recover his normal self. He had
a foretaste of the great experiences yet to come and realized that the words of the
Vedānta were true.
At the beginning of 1884 Narendra's father suddenly died of heart-failure, leaving the
family in a state of utmost poverty. There were six or seven mouths to feed at home.
Creditors were knocking at the door. Relatives who had accepted his father's unstinted
kindness now became enemies, some even bringing suit to deprive Narendra of his
ancestral home. Actually starving and barefoot, Narendra searched for a job, but without
success. He began to doubt whether anywhere in the world there was such a thing as
unselfish sympathy. Two rich women made evil proposals to him and promised to put an
end to his distress; but he refused them with contempt.
Narendra began to talk of his doubt of the very existence of God. His friends thought he
had become an atheist and piously circulated gossip adducing unmentionable motives for
his unbelief. His moral character was maligned. Even some of the Master's disciples
partly believed the gossip, and Narendra told these to their faces that only a coward
believed in God through fear of suffering or hell. But he was distressed to think that Sri
Ramakrishna, too, might believe these false reports. His pride revolted. He said to
himself: "What does it matter? If a man's good name rests on such slender foundations,
I don't care." But later on he was amazed to learn that the Master had never lost faith in
him. To a disciple who complained about Narendra's degradation, Sri Ramakrishna
replied: "Hush, you fool! The Mother has told me it can never be so. I won't look at you
if you speak that way again."
The moment came when Narendra's distress reached its climax. He had gone the whole
day without food. As he was returning home in the evening he could hardly lift his tired
limbs. He sat down in front of a house in sheer exhaustion, too weak even to think. His
mind began to wander. Then, suddenly, a divine power lifted the veil over his soul. He
found the solution of the problem of the coexistence of divine justice and misery, the
69presence of suffering in the creation of a blissful Providence. He felt bodily refreshed, his
soul was bathed in peace, and he slept serenely.
Narendra now realized that he had a spiritual mission to fulfil. He resolved to renounce
the world, as his grandfather had renounced it, and he came to Sri Ramakrishna for his
blessing. But even before he had opened his mouth, the Master knew what was in his
mind and wept bitterly at the thought of separation. "I know you cannot lead a worldly
life," he said, "but for my sake live in the world as long as I live."
One day, soon after, Narendra requested Sri Ramakrishna to pray to the Divine Mother
to remove his poverty. Sri Ramakrishna bade him pray to Her himself, for She would
certainly listen to his prayer. Narendra entered the shrine of Kāli. As he stood before the
image of the Mother, he beheld Her as a living Goddess, ready to give wisdom and
liberation. Unable to ask Her for petty worldly things, he prayed only for knowledge and
renunciation, love and liberation. The Master rebuked him for his failure to ask the
Divine Mother to remove his poverty and sent him back to the temple. But Narendra,
standing in Her presence, again forgot the purpose of his coming. Thrice he went to the
temple at the bidding of the Master, and thrice he returned, having forgotten in Her
presence why he had come. He was wondering about it when it suddenly flashed in his
mind that this was all the work of Sri Ramakrishna; so now he asked the Master himself
to remove his poverty, and was assured that his family would not lack simple food and
clothing.
This was a very rich and significant experience for Narendra. It taught him that Śakti,
the Divine Power, cannot be ignored in the world and that in the relative plane the need
of worshipping a Personal God is imperative. Sri Ramakrishna was overjoyed with the
conversion. The next day, sitting almost on Narendra's lap, he said to a devotee,
pointing first to himself, then to Narendra: "I see I am this, and again that. Really I feel
no difference. A stick floating in the Ganges seems to divide the water; but in reality the
water is one. Do you see my point? Well, whatever is, is the Mother - isn't that so?" In
later years Narendra would say: "Sri Ramakrishna was the only person who, from the
time he met me, believed in me uniformly throughout. Even my mother and brothers did
not. It was his unwavering trust and love for me that bound me to him for ever. He
alone knew how to love. Worldly people only make a show of love for selfish ends."
Tārak
Others destined to be monastic disciples of Sri Ramakrishna came to Dakshineśwar.
Tāraknāth Ghoshāl had felt from his boyhood the noble desire to realize God. Keshab
and the Brāhmo Samāj had attracted him but proved inadequate. In 1882 he first met
the Master at Rāmchandra's house and was astonished to hear him talk about Samādhi,
a subject which always fascinated his mind. And that evening he actually saw a
manifestation of that superconscious state in the Master. Tārak became a frequent
visitor at Dakshineśwar and received the Master's grace in abundance. The young boy
often felt ecstatic fervour in meditation. He also wept profusely while meditating on God.
Sri Ramakrishna said to him: "God favours those who can weep for Him. Tears shed for
God wash away the sins of former births."
70Bāburām
Bāburām Ghosh came to Dakshineśwar accompanied by Rākhāl, his classmate. The
Master, as was often his custom, examined the boy's physiognomy and was satisfied
about his latent spirituality. At the age of eight Bāburām had thought of leading a life of
renunciation, in the company of a monk, in a hut shut out from the public view by a
thick wall of trees. The very sight of the Panchavati awakened in his heart that dream of
boyhood. Bāburām was tender in body and soul. The Master used to say that he was
pure to his very bones. One day Hazra in his usual mischievous fashion advised Bāburām
and some of the other young boys to ask Sri Ramakrishna for some spiritual powers and
not waste their life in mere gaiety and merriment. The Master, scenting mischief, called
Bāburām to his side, and said: "What can you ask of me? Isn't everything that I have
already yours? Yes, everything I have earned in the shape of realizations is for the sake
of you all. So get rid of the idea of begging, which alienates by creating a distance.
Rather realize your kinship with me and gain the key to all the treasures."
Niranjan
Nitya Niranjan Sen was a disciple of heroic type. He came to the Master when he was
eighteen years old. He was a medium for a group of spiritualists. During his first visit the
Master said to him: "My boy, if you think always of ghosts you will become a ghost, and
if you think of God you will become God. Now, which do you prefer?" Niranjan severed
all connections with the spiritualists. During his second visit the Master embraced him
and said warmly: "Niranjan, my boy, the days are flitting away. When will you realize
God? This life will be in vain if you do not realize Him. When will You devote your mind
wholly to God?" Niranjan was surprised to see the Master's great anxiety for his spiritual
welfare. He was a young man endowed with unusual spiritual parts. He felt disdain for
worldly pleasures and was totally guileless, like a child. But he had a violent temper. One
day, as he was coming in a country boat to Dakshineśwar, some of his fellow passengers
began to speak ill of the Master. Finding his protest futile, Niranjan began to rock the
boat, threatening to sink it in midstream. That silenced the offenders. When he reported
the incident to the Master, he was rebuked for his inability to curb his anger.
Jogindra
Jogindranāth, on the other hand, was gentle to a fault. One day, under circumstances
very like those that had evoked Niranjan's anger, he curbed his temper and held his
peace instead of threatening Sri Ramakrishna's abusers. The Master, learning of his
conduct, scolded him roundly. Thus to each the fault of the other was recommended as a
virtue. The guru was striving to develop, in the first instance, composure, and in the
second, mettle. The secret of his training was to build up, by a tactful recognition of the
requirements of each given case, the character of the devotee.
Jogindranāth came of an aristocratic brāhmin family of Dakshineśwar. His father and
relatives shared the popular mistrust of Sri Ramakrishna's sanity. At a very early age the
boy developed religious tendencies, spending two or three hours daily in meditation, and
his meeting with Sri Ramakrishna deepened his desire for the realization of God. He had
a perfect horror of marriage. But at the earnest request of his mother he had had to
71yield, and he now believed that his spiritual future was doomed. So he kept himself away
from the Master.
Sri Ramakrishna employed a ruse to bring Jogindra to him. As soon as the disciple
entered the room, the Master rushed forward to meet the young man. Catching hold of
the disciple's hand, he said: "What if you have married, Haven't I too married? What is
there to be afraid of in that?" Touching his own chest he said: "If this [meaning himself]
is propitious, then even a hundred thousand marriages cannot injure you. It you desire
to lead a householder's life, then bring your wife here one day, and I shall see that she
becomes a real companion in your spiritual progress. But if you want to lead a monastic
life, then I shall eat up your attachment to the world." Jogin was dumbfounded at these
words. He received new strength, and his spirit of renunciation was re-established.
Śashi and Śarat
Śashi and Śarat were two cousins who came from a pious brāhmin family of Calcutta. At
an early age they had joined the Brāhmo Samāj and had come under the influence of
Keshab Sen. The Master said to them at their first meeting: "If bricks and tiles are burnt
after the trade-mark has been stamped on them, they retain the mark for ever.
Similarly, man should be stamped with God before entering the world. Then he will not
become attached to worldliness." Fully aware of the future course of their life, he asked
them not to marry. The Master asked Śashi whether he believed in God with form or in
God without form. Śashi replied that he was not even sure about the existence of God;
so he could not speak one way or the other. This frank answer very much pleased the
Master.
Śarat's soul longed for the all-embracing realization of the Godhead. When the Master
inquired whether there was any particular form of God he wished to see, the boy replied
that he would like to see God in all the living beings of the world. "But", the Master
demurred, "that is the last word in realization. One cannot have it at the very outset."
Śarat stated calmly: "I won't be satisfied with anything short of that. I shall trudge on
along the path till I attain that blessed state." Sri Ramakrishna was very much pleased.
Harināth
Harināth had led the austere life of a brahmachāri even from his early boyhood -bathing
in the Ganges every day, cooking his own meals, waking before sunrise, and reciting the
Gita from memory before leaving bed. He found in the Master the embodiment of the
Vedānta scriptures. Aspiring to be a follower of the ascetic Śankara, he cherished a great
hatred for women. One day he said to the Master that he could not allow even small girls
to come near him. The Master scolded him and said: "You are talking like a fool. Why
should you hate women? They are the manifestations of the Divine Mother. Regard them
as your own mother and you will never feel their evil influence. The more you hate them,
the more you will fall into their snares." Hari said later that these words completely
changed his attitude toward women.
The Master knew Hari's passion for Vedānta. But he did not wish any of his disciples to
become a dry ascetic or a mere bookworm. So he asked Hari to practise Vedānta in life
72by giving up the unreal and following the Real. "But it is not so easy", Sri Ramakrishna
said, "to realize the illusoriness of the world. Study alone does not help one very much.
The grace of God is required. Mere personal effort is futile. A man is a tiny creature after
all, with very limited powers. But he can achieve the impossible if he prays to God for
His grace." Whereupon the Master sang a song in praise of grace. Hari was profoundly
moved and shed tears. Later in life Hari achieved a wonderful synthesis of the ideals of
the Personal God and the Impersonal Truth.
Gangādhar
Gangādhar, Harināth's friend, also led the life of a strict brahmachari , eating vegetarian
food cooked by his own hands and devoting himself to the study of the scriptures. He
met the Master in 1884 and soon became a member of his inner circle. The Master
praised his ascetic habit and attributed it to the spiritual disciplines of his past life.
Gangādhar became a close companion of Narendra.
Hariprasanna
Hariprasanna, a college student, visited the Master in the company of his friends Śashi
and Śarat. Sri Ramakrishna showed him great favour by initiating him into spiritual life.
As long as he lived, Hariprasanna remembered and observed the following drastic advice
of the Master: "Even if a woman is pure as gold and rolls on the ground for love of God,
it is dangerous for a monk ever to look at her."
Kāli
Kāliprasād visited the Master toward the end of 1883. Given to the practice of meditation
and the study of the scriptures, Kāli was particularly interested in yoga. Feeling the need
of a guru in spiritual life, he came to the Master and was accepted as a disciple. The
young boy possessed a rational mind and often felt sceptical about the Personal God.
The Master said to him: "Your doubts will soon disappear. Others, too, have passed
through such a state of mind. Look at Naren. He now weeps at the names of Rādhā and
Krishna." Kāli began to see visions of gods and goddesses. Very soon these disappeared
and in meditation he experienced vastness, infinity, and the other attributes of the
Impersonal Brahman.
Subodh
Subodh visited the Master in 1885. At the very first meeting Sri Ramakrishna said to
him: "You will succeed. Mother says so. Those whom She sends here will certainly attain
spirituality." During the second meeting the Master wrote something on Subodh's
tongue, stroked his body from the navel to the throat, and said, "Awake, Mother!
Awake." He asked the boy to meditate. At once Subodh's latent spirituality was
awakened. He felt a current rushing along the spinal column to the brain. Joy filled his
soul.
Sāradā and Tulasi
Two more young men, Sāradā Prasanna and Tulasi, complete the small band of the
Master's disciples later to embrace the life of the wandering monk. With the exception of
the elder Gopāl, all of them were in their teens or slightly over. They came from middle-
73class Bengāli families, and most of them were students in school or college. Their
parents and relatives had envisaged for them bright worldly careers. They came to Sri
Ramakrishna with pure bodies, vigorous minds, and uncontaminated souls. All were born
with unusual spiritual attributes. Sri Ramakrishna accepted them, even at first sight, as
his children, relatives, friends, and companions. His magic touch unfolded them. And
later each according to his measure reflected the life of the Master, becoming a torch-
bearer of his message across land and sea.
Woman Devotees
With his woman devotees Sri Ramakrishna established a very sweet relationship. He
himself embodied the tender traits of a woman; he had dwelt on the highest plane of
Truth, where there is not even the slightest trace of sex; and his innate purity evoked
only the noblest emotion in men and women alike. His woman devotees often said: "We
seldom looked on Sri Ramakrishna as a member of the male sex. We regarded him as
one of us. We never felt any constraint before him, He was our best confidant." They
loved him as their child, their friend, and their teacher. In spiritual discipline he advised
them to renounce lust and greed and especially warned them not to fall into the snares
of men.
Gopāl Mā
Unsurpassed among the woman devotees of the Master in the richness of her devotion
and spiritual experiences was Aghoramani Devi, an orthodox brāhmin woman. Widowed
at an early age, she had dedicated herself completely to spiritual pursuits. Gopālā, the
Baby Krishna, was her Ideal Deity, whom she worshipped following the Vātsalya attitude
of the Vaishnava religion, regarding Him as her own child. Through Him she satisfied her
unassuaged maternal love, cooking for Him, feeding Him, bathing Him, and putting Him
to bed. This sweet intimacy with Gopālā won her the sobriquet of Gopāl Mā, or Gopālā's
Mother. For forty years she had lived on the bank of the Ganges in a small bare room,
her only companions being a threadbare copy of the Ramayana and a bag containing her
rosary. At the age of sixty, in 1884, she visited Sri Ramakrishna at Dakshineśwar.
During the second visit, as soon as the Master saw her, he said: "Oh, you have come!
Give me something to eat." With great hesitation she gave him some ordinary sweets
that she had purchased for him on the way. The Master ate them with relish and asked
her to bring him simple curries or sweets prepared by her own hands. Gopāl Mā thought
him a queer kind of monk, for, instead of talking of God, he always asked for food. She
did not want to visit him again, but an irresistible attraction brought her back to the
temple garden. She carried with her some simple curries that she had cooked herself.
One early morning at three o'clock, about a year later, Gopāl Mā was about to finish her
daily devotions, when she was startled to find Sri Ramakrishna sitting on her left, with
his right hand clenched, like the hand of the image of Gopālā. She was amazed and
caught hold of the hand, whereupon the figure vanished and in its place appeared the
real Gopālā, her Ideal Deity. She cried aloud with joy. Gopālā begged her for butter. She
pleaded her poverty and gave Him some dry coconut candies. Gopālā sat on her lap,
snatched away her rosary, jumped on her shoulders, and moved all about the room. As
soon as the day broke she hastened to Dakshineśwar like an insane woman. Of course
74Gopālā accompanied her, resting His head on her shoulder. She clearly saw His tiny
ruddy feet hanging over her breast. She entered Sri Ramakrishna's room. The Master
had fallen into Samādhi. Like a child, he sat on her lap, and she began to feed him with
butter, cream, and other delicacies. After some time he regained consciousness and
returned to his bed. But the mind of Gopālā's Mother was still roaming in another plane.
She was steeped in bliss. She saw Gopālā frequently entering the Master's body and
again coming out of it. When she returned to her hut, still in a dazed condition, Gopālā
accompanied her.
She spent about two months in uninterrupted communion with God, the Baby Gopālā
never leaving her for a moment. Then the intensity of her vision was lessened; had it not
been, her body would have perished. The Master spoke highly of her exalted spiritual
condition and said that such vision of God was a rare thing for ordinary mortals. The fun-
loving Master one day confronted the critical Narendranāth with this simple-minded
woman. No two could have presented a more striking contrast. The Master knew of
Narendra's lofty contempt for all visions, and he asked the old lady to narrate her
experiences to Narendra. With great hesitation she told him her story. Now and then she
interrupted her maternal chatter to ask Narendra: "My son, I am a poor ignorant
woman. I don't understand anything. You are so learned. Now tell me if these visions of
Gopālā are true." As Narendra listened to the story he was profoundly moved. He said,
"Yes, mother, they are quite true." Behind his cynicism Narendra, too, possessed a heart
full of love and tenderness.
The March of Events
In 1882 Hriday was, dismissed from service in the Ka1i temple, for an act of indiscretion,
and was ordered by the authorities never again to enter the garden. In a way the hand
of the Divine Mother may be seen even in this. Having taken care of Sri Ramakrishna
during the stormy days of his spiritual discipline, Hriday had come naturally to consider
himself the sole guardian of his uncle. None could approach the Master without his
knowledge. And he would be extremely jealous if Sri Ramakrishna paid attention to
anyone else. Hriday's removal made it possible for the real devotees of the Master to
approach him freely and live with him in the temple garden.
During the week-ends the householders, enjoying a respite from their office duties,
visited the Master. The meetings on Sunday afternoons were of the nature of little
festivals. Refreshments were often served. Professional musicians now and then sang
devotional songs. The Master and the devotees sang and danced, Sri Ramakrishna
frequently going into ecstatic moods. The happy memory of such a Sunday would linger
long in the minds of the devotees. Those whom the Master wanted for special instruction
he would ask to visit him on Tuesdays and Saturdays. These days were particularly
auspicious for the worship of Kāli.
The young disciples destined to be monks, Sri Ramakrishna invited on week-days, when
the householders were not present. The training of the householders and of the future
monks had to proceed along entirely different lines. Since M. generally visited the Master
75on week-ends, the Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna does not contain much mention of the
future monastic disciples.
Finally, there was a handful of fortunate disciples, householders as well as youngsters,
who were privileged to spend nights with the Master in his room. They would see him get
up early in the morning and walk up and down the room, singing in his sweet voice and
tenderly communing with the Mother.
Injury to the Master's Arm
One day, in January 1884, the Master was going toward the pine-grove when he went
into a trance. He was alone. There was no one to support him or guide his footsteps. He
fell to the ground and dislocated a bone in his left arm. This accident had a significant
influence on his mind, the natural inclination of which was to soar above the
consciousness of the body. The acute pain in the arm forced his mind to dwell on the
body and on the world outside. But he saw even in this a divine purpose; for, with his
mind compelled to dwell on the physical plane, he realized more than ever that he was
an instrument in the hand of the Divine Mother, who had a mission to fulfil through his
human body and mind. He also distinctly found that in the phenomenal world God
manifests Himself, in an inscrutable way, through diverse human beings, both good and
evil. Thus he would speak of God in the guise of the wicked, God in the guise of the
pious, God in the guise of the hypocrite, God in the guise of the lewd. He began to take
a special delight in watching the divine play in the relative world. Sometimes the sweet
human relationship with God would appear to him more appealing than the all-effacing
Knowledge of Brahman. Many a time he would pray: "Mother, don't make me
unconscious through the Knowledge of Brahman. Don't give me Brahmajnāna, Mother.
Am I not Your child, and naturally timid? I must have my Mother. A million salutations to
the Knowledge of Brahman! Give it to those who want it." Again he prayed: "O Mother,
let me remain in contact with men! Don't make me a dried-up ascetic. I want to enjoy
Your sport in the world." He was able to taste this very rich divine experience and enjoy
the love of God and the company of His devotees because his mind, on account of the
injury to his arm, was forced to come down to the consciousness of the body. Again, he
would make fun of people who proclaimed him as a Divine Incarnation, by pointing to his
broken arm. He would say, "Have you ever heard of God breaking His arm?" It took the
arm about five months to heal.
Beginning of His Illness
In April 1885 the Master's throat became inflamed. Prolonged conversation or absorption
in Samādhi, making the blood flow into the throat, would aggravate the pain. Yet when
the annual Vaishnava festival was celebrated at Pānihāti, Sri Ramakrishna attended it
against the doctor's advice. With a group of disciples he spent himself in music, dance,
and ecstasy. The illness took a turn for the worse and was diagnosed as "clergyman's
sore throat". The patient was cautioned against conversation and ecstasies. Though he
followed the physician's directions regarding medicine and diet, he could neither control
his trances nor withhold from seekers the solace of his advice. Sometimes, like a sulky
child, he would complain to the Mother about the crowds, who gave him no rest day or
night. He was overheard to say to Her: "Why do You bring here all these worthless
76people, who are like milk diluted with five times its own quantity of water? My eyes are
almost destroyed with blowing the fire to dry up the water. My health is gone. It is
beyond my strength. Do it Yourself, if You want it done. This (pointing to his own body)
is but a perforated drum, and if you go on beating it day in and day out, how long will it
last?"
But his large heart never turned anyone away. He said, "Let me be condemned to be
born over and over again, even in the form of a dog, if I can be of help to a single soul."
And he bore the pain, singing cheerfully, "Let the body be preoccupied with illness, but,
O mind, dwell for ever in God's Bliss!"
One night he had a haemorrhage of the throat. The doctor now diagnosed the illness as
cancer. Narendra was the first to break this heart-rending news to the disciples. Within
three days the Master was removed to Calcutta for better treatment. At Balarām's house
he remained a week until a suitable place could be found at Śyāmpukur, in the northern
section of Calcutta. During this week he dedicated himself practically without respite to
the instruction of those beloved devotees who had been unable to visit him oftener at
Dakshineśwar. Discourses incessantly flowed from his tongue, and he often went into
Samādhi. Dr. Mahendra Sarkār, the celebrated homeopath of Calcutta, was invited to
undertake his treatment.
Śyāmpukur
In the beginning of September 1885 Sri Ramakrishna was moved to Śyāmpukur. Here
Narendra organized the young disciples to attend the Master day and night. At first they
concealed the Master's illness from their guardians; but when it became more serious
they remained with him almost constantly, sweeping aside the objections of their
relatives and devoting themselves whole-heartedly to the nursing of their beloved guru.
These young men, under the watchful eyes of the Master and the leadership of
Narendra, became the Antaranga Bhaktās, the devotees of Sri Ramakrishna's inner
circle. They were privileged to witness many manifestations of the Master's divine
powers. Narendra received instructions regarding the propagation of his message after
his death.
The Holy Mother - so Sāradā Devi had come to be affectionately known by Sri
Ramakrishna's devotees - was brought from Dakshineśwar to look after the general
cooking and to prepare the special diet of the patient. The dwelling space being
extremely limited, she had to adapt herself to cramped conditions. At three o'clock in the
morning she would finish her bath in the Ganges and then enter a small covered place
on the roof, where she spent the whole day cooking and praying. After eleven at night,
when the visitors went away, she would come down to her small bedroom on the first
floor to enjoy a few hours' sleep. Thus she spent three months, working hard, sleeping
little, and praying constantly for the Master's recovery.
At Śyāmpukur the devotees led an intense life. Their attendance on the Master was in
itself a form of spiritual discipline. His mind was constantly soaring to an exalted plane of
consciousness. Now and then they would catch the contagion of his spiritual fervour.
77They sought to divine the meaning of this illness of the Master, whom most of them had
accepted as an Incarnation of God. One group, headed by Girish with his robust
optimism and great power of imagination, believed that the illness was a mere pretext to
serve a deeper purpose. The Master had willed his illness in order to bring the devotees
together and promote solidarity among them. As soon as this purpose was served, he
would himself get rid of the disease. A second group thought that the Divine Mother, in
whose hand the Master was an instrument, had brought about this illness to serve Her
own mysterious ends. But the young rationalists, led by Narendra, refused to ascribe a
supernatural cause to a natural phenomenon. They believed that the Master's body, a
material thing, was subject, like all other material things, to physical laws. Growth,
development, decay, and death were laws of nature to which the Master's body could not
but respond. But though holding differing views, they all believed that it was to him
alone that they must look for the attainment of their spiritual goal.
In spite of the physician's efforts and the prayers and nursing of the devotees, the illness
rapidly progressed. The pain sometimes appeared to be unbearable. The Master lived
only on liquid food, and his frail body was becoming a mere skeleton. Yet his face always
radiated joy, and he continued to welcome the visitors pouring in to receive his blessing.
When certain zealous devotees tried to keep the visitors away, they were told by Girish,
"You cannot succeed in it; he has been born for this very purpose - to sacrifice himself
for the redemption of others."
The more the body was devastated by illness, the more it became the habitation of the
Divine Spirit. Through its transparency the gods and goddesses began to shine with ever
increasing luminosity. On the day of the Kāli Puja the devotees clearly saw in him the
manifestation of the Divine Mother.
It was noticed at this time that some of the devotees were making an unbridled display
of their emotions. A number of them, particularly among the householders, began to
cultivate, though at first unconsciously, the art of shedding tears, shaking the body,
contorting the face, and going into trances, attempting thereby to imitate the Master.
They began openly to declare Sri Ramakrishna a Divine Incarnation and to regard
themselves as his chosen people, who could neglect religious disciplines with impunity.
Narendra's penetrating eye soon sized up the situation. He found out that some of these
external manifestations were being carefully practised at home, while some were the
outcome of malnutrition, mental weakness, or nervous debility. He mercilessly exposed
the devotees who were pretending to have visions, and asked all to develop a healthy
religious spirit. Narendra sang inspiring songs for the younger devotees, read with them
the Imitation of Christ and the Gita, and held before them the positive ideals of
spirituality.
Last Days at Cossipore
When Sri Ramakrishna's illness showed signs of aggravation, the devotees, following the
advice of Dr. Sarkār, rented a spacious garden house at Cossipore, in the northern
suburbs of Calcutta. The Master was removed to this place on December 11, 1885.
78It was at Cossipore that the curtain fell on the varied activities of the Master's life on the
physical plane. His soul lingered in the body eight months more. It was the period of his
great Passion, a constant crucifixion of the body and the triumphant revelation of the
Soul. Here one sees the humanity and divinity of the Master passing and repassing
across a thin border line. Every minute of those eight months was suffused with touching
tenderness of heart and breath-taking elevation of spirit. Every word he uttered was full
of pathos and sublimity.
It took the group only a few days to become adjusted to the new environment. The Holy
Mother, assisted by Sri Ramakrishna's niece, Lakshmi Devi, and a few woman devotees,
took charge of the cooking for the Master and his attendants. Surendra willingly bore the
major portion of the expenses, other householders contributing according to their
means. Twelve disciples were constant attendants of the Master: Narendra, Rākhāl,
Bāburām, Niranjan, Jogin, Lātu, Tārak, the elder Gopāl, Kāli, Śashi, Śarat, and the
younger Gopāl. Sāradā, Harish, Hari, Gangādhar, and Tulasi visited the Master from time
to time and practised sādhana at home. Narendra, preparing for his law examination,
brought his books to the garden house in order to continue his studies during the
infrequent spare moments. He encouraged his brother disciples to intensify their
meditation, scriptural studies, and other spiritual disciplines. They all forgot their
relatives and their worldly duties.
Among the attendants Śashi was the embodiment of service. He did not practise
meditation, japa, or any of the other disciplines followed by his brother devotees. He was
convinced that service to the guru was the only religion for him. He forgot food and rest
and was ever ready at the Master's bedside.
Pundit Śaśadhar one day suggested to the Master that the latter could remove the illness
by concentrating his mind on the throat, the scriptures having declared that yogis had
power to cure themselves in that way. The Master rebuked the pundit. "For a scholar like
you to make such a proposal!" he said. "How can I withdraw the mind from the Lotus
Feet of God and turn it to this worthless cage of flesh and blood?" "For our sake at
least", begged Narendra and the other disciples. "But", replied Sri Ramakrishna, "do you
think I enjoy this suffering? I wish to recover, but that depends on the Mother."
NARENDRA:

least."
A few hours later the Master said to Narendra: "I said to Her: 'Mother, I cannot swallow
food because of my pain. Make it possible for me to eat a little.' She pointed you all out
to me and said: 'What? You are eating enough through all these mouths. Isn't that so?' I
was ashamed and could not utter another word." This dashed all the hopes of the
devotees for the Master's recovery.
79"I shall make the whole thing public before I go", the Master had said some time before.
On January 1, 1886, he felt better and came down to the garden for a little stroll. It was
about three o'clock in the afternoon. Some thirty lay disciples were in the hall or sitting
about under the trees. Sri Ramakrishna said to Girish, "Well, Girish, what have you seen
in me, that you proclaim me before everybody as an Incarnation of God?" Girish was not
the man to be taken by surprise. He knelt before the Master and said with folded hands,
"What can an insignificant person like myself say about the One whose glory even sages
like Vyāsa and Vālmiki could not adequately measure?" The Master was profoundly
moved. He said: "What more shall I say? I bless you all. Be illumined!" He fell into a
spiritual mood. Hearing these words the devotees, one and all, became overwhelmed
with emotion. They rushed to him and fell at his feet. He touched them all, and each
received an appropriate benediction. Each of them, at the touch of the Master,
experienced ineffable bliss. Some laughed, some wept, some sat down to meditate,
some began to pray. Some saw light, some had visions of their Chosen Ideals, and some
felt within their bodies the rush of spiritual power.
Narendra, consumed with a terrific fever for realization, complained to the Master that all
the others had attained peace and that he alone was dissatisfied. The Master asked what
he wanted. Narendra begged for Samādhi, so that he might altogether forget the world
for three or four days at a time. "You are a fool", the Master rebuked him. "There is a
state even higher than that. Isn't it you who sing, 'All that exists art Thou'? First of all
settle your family affairs and then come to me. You will experience a state even higher
than Samādhi."
The Master did not hide the fact that he wished to make Narendra his spiritual heir.
Narendra was to continue the work after Sri Ramakrishna's passing. Sri Ramakrishna
said to him: "I leave these young men in your charge. See that they develop their
spirituality and do not return home." One day he asked the boys, in preparation for a
monastic life, to beg their food from door to door without thought of caste. They hailed
the Master's order and went out with begging-bowls. A few days later he gave the ochre
cloth of the sannyāsi to each of them, including Girish, who was now second to none in
his spirit of renunciation. Thus the Master himself laid the foundation of the future
Ramakrishna Order of monks.
Sri Ramakrishna was sinking day by day. His diet was reduced to a minimum and he
found it almost impossible to swallow. He whispered to M.: "I am bearing all this
cheerfully, for otherwise you would be weeping. If you all say that it is better that the
body should go rather than suffer this torture, I am willing." The next morning he said to
his depressed disciples seated near the bed: "Do you know what I see? I see that God
alone has become everything. Men and animals are only frameworks covered with skin,
and it is He who is moving through their heads and limbs. I see that it is God Himself
who has become the block, the executioner, and the victim for the sacrifice." He fainted
with emotion. Regaining partial consciousness, he said: "Now I have no pain. I am very
well." Looking at Lātu he said: "There sits Lātu resting his head on the palm of his hand.
To me it is the Lord who is seated in that posture."
80The words were tender and touching. Like a mother he caressed Narendra and Rākhāl,
gently stroking their faces. He said in a half whisper to M., "Had this body been allowed
to last a little longer, many more souls would have been illumined." He paused a
moment and then said: "But Mother has ordained otherwise. She will take me away lest,
finding me guileless and foolish, people should take advantage of me and persuade me
to bestow on them the rare gifts of spirituality." A few minutes later he touched his chest
and said: "Here are two beings. One is She and the other is Her devotee. It is the latter
who broke his arm, and it is he again who is now ill. Do you understand me?" After a
pause he added: "Alas! To whom shall I tell all this? Who will understand me?" "Pain", he
consoled them again, "is unavoidable as long as there is a body. The Lord takes on the
body for the sake of His devotees."
Yet one is not sure whether the Master's soul actually was tortured by this agonizing
disease. At least during his moments of spiritual exaltation - which became almost
constant during the closing days of his life on earth - he lost all consciousness of the
body, of illness and suffering. One of his attendants said later on: "While Sri
Ramakrishna lay sick he never actually suffered pain. He would often say: 'O mind!
Forget the body, forget the sickness, and remain merged in Bliss.' No, he did not really
suffer. At times, he would be in a state when the thrill of joy was clearly manifested in
his body. Even when he could not speak he would let us know in some way that there
was no suffering, and this fact was clearly evident to all who watched him. People who
did not understand him thought that his suffering was very great. What spiritual joy he
transmitted to us at that time! Could such a thing have been possible if he had been
suffering physically? It was during this period that he taught us again these truths.
'Brahman is always unattached. The three gunās are in It, but It is unaffected by them,
just as the wind carries odour yet remains odourless.' 'Brahman is Infinite Being, In
finite Wisdom, Infinite Bliss. In It there exist no delusion, no misery, no disease, no
death, no growth, no decay.' 'The Transcendental Being and the being within are one
and the same. There is one indivisible Absolute Existence.' "
The Holy Mother secretly went to a Śiva temple across the Ganges to intercede with the
Deity for the Master's recovery. In a revelation she was told to prepare herself for the
inevitable end.
One day when Narendra was on the ground floor, meditating, the Master was lying
awake in his bed upstairs. In the depths of his meditation Narendra felt as though a
lamp were burning at the back of his head. Suddenly he lost consciousness. It was the
yearned-for, all-effacing experience of nirvikalpa Samādhi, when the embodied soul
realizes its unity with the Absolute. After a very long time he regained partial
consciousness but was unable to find his body. He could see only his head. "Where is my
body?" he cried. The elder Gopāl entered the room and said, "Why, it is here, Naren!"
But Narendra could not find it. Gopāl, frightened, ran upstairs to the Master. Sri
Ramakrishna only said: "Let him stay that way for a time. He has worried me long
enough."

After another long period Narendra regained full consciousness. Bathed in peace, he went to the Master, who said: "Now the Mother has shown you everything. But this revelation will remain under lock and key, and I shall keep the key. When you have
accomplished the Mother's work you will find the treasure again."

Some days later, Narendra being alone with the Master, Sri Ramakrishna looked at him
and went into Samādhi. Narendra felt the penetration of a subtle force and lost all outer
consciousness. Regaining presently the normal mood, he found the Master weeping.
Sri Ramakrishna said to him: "Today I have given you my all and I am now only a poor
fakir, possessing nothing. By this power you will do immense good in the world, and not
until it is accomplished will you return." Henceforth the Master lived in the disciple.
Doubt, however, dies hard. After one or two days Narendra said to himself, "If in the
midst of this racking physical pain he declares his Godhead, then only shall I accept him
as an Incarnation of God." He was alone by the bedside of the Master. It was a passing
thought, but the Master smiled. Gathering his remaining strength, he distinctly said, "He
who was Rāmā and Krishna is now, in this body, Ramakrishna - but not in your Vedāntic
sense." Narendra was stricken with shame.

## Mahā–samādhi

Sunday, August 15, 1886. The Master's pulse became irregular. The devotees stood by
the bedside. Toward dusk Sri Ramakrishna had difficulty in breathing. A short time
afterwards he complained of hunger. A little liquid food was put into his mouth; some of
it he swallowed, and the rest ran over his chin. Two attendants began to fan him. All at
once he went into Samādhi of a rather unusual type. The body became stiff. Śaśi burst
into tears. But after midnight the Master revived. He was now very hungry and helped
himself to a bowl of porridge. He said he was strong again. He sat up against five or six
pillows, which were supported by the body of Śashi, who was fanning him. Narendra
took his feet on his lap and began to rub them. Again and again, the Master repeated to
him, "Take care of these boys." Then, he asked to lie down. Three times in ringing tones
he cried the name of Kāli, his life's Beloved, and lay back. At two minutes past one there
was a low sound in his throat and he fell a little to one side. A thrill passed over his
body. His hair stood on end. His eyes became fixed on the tip of his nose. His face was
lighted with a smile. The final ecstasy began. It was Mahā–samādhi, total absorption,
from which his mind never returned. Narendra, unable to bear it, ran downstairs.
Dr. Sarkār arrived the following noon and pronounced that life had departed not more
than half an hour before. At five o'clock the Master's body was brought downstairs, laid
on a cot, dressed in ochre clothes, and decorated with sandal-past and flowers. A
procession was formed. The passers-by wept as the body was taken to the cremation
ground at the Bārānagore Ghāt on the Ganges.
While the devotees were returning to the garden house, carrying the urn with the sacred
ashes, a calm resignation came to their souls and they cried, "Victory unto the Guru!"
82The Holy Mother was weeping in her room, not for her husband, but because she felt
that Mother Kāli had left her. As she was about to put off the marks of a Hindu widow, in
a moment of revelation she heard the words of faith "I have only passed from one room
to another."
