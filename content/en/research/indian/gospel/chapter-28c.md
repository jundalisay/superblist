PRIYA (smiling): "Sir, our legs are in chains. We cannot go forward."

MASTER: "What if the legs are chained? The important thing is the mind. Bondage is of the mind, and freedom also is of the mind.
"Listen to a story. There were two friends. One went into a house of prostitution and the other to hear a recital of the Bhagavata. 'What a shame!' thought the first. 'My friend is hearing spiritual discourse, but just see what I have slipped down to!' The second friend
said to himself: 

'Shame on me! My friend is having a good time, but how stupid I am!' After death the soul of the first was taken to Vaikuntha by the messenger of Vishnu,
while that of the second was taken to the nether world of Yama."

PRIYA: "But the mind is not under my control."

MASTER: "How is that? There is such a thing as abhyiisayoga, yoga through practice.

Keep up the practice and you will find that your mind will follow in whatever direction you lead it. The mind is like a white cloth just returned from the laundry. It will be red if you dip it in red dye and blue if you dip it in blue. It will have whatever colour you dip it in.

(To Goswami) "Have you anything to ask?" 

GOSWAMI: "No, sir. I am satisfied that I have seen you and have been I listening to
your words."

MASTER: "Go and visit the temples."

GOSWAMI (very humbly): "Won't you please sing something about Sri Chaitanya?"

The Master complied. He sang:
Why has My body turned so golden?It is not time for this to
be:
Many the ages that must pass, before as Gaurānga I appear! . .
Again:
Gora gazes at Vrindāvan and tears stream from his eyes;
In an exuberance of joy, he laughs and weeps and dances and sings.

He takes a wood for Vrindāvan, the ocean for the blue Jamuna;


He rolls on the ground for love of Hari.

After singing, the Master went on with the conversation.

MASTER (to Goswami): "I have sung these songs to suit your Vaishnava temperament. But I must sing differently when the Saktas or others come.

Herepeople of all sects come-Vaishnavas, Saktas, Kartabhajas,Vedantists, and also
members of the modern Brahmo Samaj. Therefore one finds here all ideals and attitudes. It is by the will of God that different religions and opinions have come into
existence. 

God gives to different people what they can digest. The mother does not give fish pilau to all her children. All cannot digest it; so she prepares simple fish soup for
some. Everyone cherishes his own special ideal and follows his own nature.

They provide various images for the Baroari because people of different sects assemble at it. You see there images of Radha-Krishna, Śiva-Durga, and Sita-Rāma-different images in different places. A crowd gathers before each image. The Vaishnavas spend
most of their time before the image of Radha-Krishna, the Saktas before Śiva-Durga,
and the devotees of Rāma before Sita-Rāma.

But it is quite different with those who are not spiritually minded at all. In the Baroari one sees another image also-a prostitute beating her paramour with a broomstick. Those people stand there with gaping mouths and cry to their friends: 'What are you looking at
over there? Come here! Look at this!' " (All laugh.)

Radhika Goswami saluted the Master and took his leave.

It was about five o'clock. The Master was on the semicircular west porch. Baburam, Lātu, the Mukherji brothers, M., and some other devotees were with him.
MASTER (to M. and the others): "Why should I be one-sided? The goswamis belong to the Vaishnava school and are very bigoted. They think that their opinion alone is right and all other opinions are wrong. My words have hit him hard. (Smiling) One must strike
the elephant on the head with the goad; that is the elephant's most sensitive spot."

Then Sri Ramakrishna told a few naughty jokes for the young men.

MASTER (to the devotees): "I don't give the youngsters a pure vegetarian diet: now and then I give them a little water smelling of fish. Otherwise, why should they come?" 

The Mukherji brothers left the porch. They went to the garden for a stroll.

MASTER (to M.): "I wonder whether the Mukherjis have taken offence at my jokes?"

M: "Why should they? Captain said that you are like a child. After realizing God a man becomes childlike."

MASTER: "Yes, and sometimes he behaves like a boy, and sometimes like a young man.

As a boy he is very light-hearted. He may use frivolous language. As a young man he is like a roaring lion while teaching others. You had better explain my state of mind to the Mukherjis."

M: "I don't have to do that. Haven't they the sense to see it?"

Again the Master became light-hearted with the boys. Then he said to one of the devotees: "Today is the new moon. Go to the Kāli temple in the evening."
It was dusk. They heard the sound of gongs, cymbals, and other instruments used in the evening service in. the temples. The Master said to Baburam, "Come with me to the Kāli temple." 

He and Baburam went toward the temple, accompanied by M. At the sight of Harish sitting on the porch, the Master said: "What is this? Is he in ecstasy?"
Going through the courtyard, the Master and the devotees stopped a minute in front of the Radhakanta temple to watch the worship. Then they proceeded to the shrine of Kāli.

With folded hands the Master prayed to the Divine Mother: "O Mother! O Divine Mother! O Brahmamayi!"

Reaching the raised platform in front of the shrine, he bowed low before the image. The Ārati was going on. He entered the shrine and fanned the image.
The evening worship was over. The devotees bowed before the Deity. It was the night of the new moon. The Master was in a spiritual mood. Gradually his mood deepened into intense ecstasy. 

He returned to his room, reeling like a drunkard and holding to Baburam's hand.


A lamp was lighted on the west porch. The Master sat there a few minutes, chanting:
"Hari Om! Hari Om! Hari Om!" and other mystic syllables of the Tantra. Presently he
returned to his room and sat on the small couch, facing the east. He was still completely.
absorbed in divine fervour. He said to the Divine Mother: "Mother, that I should first
speak and You then act-oh, that's nonsense! What is the meaning of talk? It is nothing
but a sign. One man says, 'I shall eat.' Again, another says, 'No! I won't hear of it.' Well,
Mother, suppose I had said I would not eat; wouldn't I still feel hungry? Is it ever
possible that You should listen only when one prays aloud and not when one feels an
inner longing? You are what You are. Then why do I speak? Why do I pray? I do as You
make me do. Oh, what confusion! Why do You make me reason?"
As Sri Ramakrishna was thus talking to God, the devotees listened wonder-struck to his
words. The Master's eyes fell upon them.
MASTER (to the devotees): "One must inherit good tendencies to realize God, One must
have done something, some form of tapasya, either in this life or in another.
"When Draupadi's clothes were being taken off, she cried earnestly, praying to God. God
revealed Himself to her and said: 'Try to remember whether you have ever made a gift
of a cloth to anyone. Then your modesty will be preserved.' Draupadi replied: 'Yes, I
remember now. Once a rishi was taking his bath when his loin-cloth was carried away by
the current. I tore off half my cloth and gave it to him.' Thereupon the Lord said, 'Then
you have nothing to fear.' "
M. was sitting on the small foot-rug.
590MASTER (to M.): "You have understood what I said."
M: "Yes, sir. You spoke about inherent tendencies."
MASTER: "Repeat what I said."
M. repeated the story of Draupadi.
Hazra entered the room. He had been living with Sri Ramakrishna in the temple garden
for the past two years and had first met the Master in 1880 at Sihore in the house of
Hriday, the Master's nephew. Hazra's native village was near Sihore, and he owned some
property there. He had a wife and children and also some debts. From youth he had felt
a spirit of renunciation and sought the company of holy men and devotees. The Master
had asked him to live with him at Dakshineswar and looked after his necessities. Hazra's
mind was a jumble of undigested religious moods. He professed the path of knowledge
and disapproved of Sri Ramakrishna's attitude of bhakti and his longing for the young
devotees. Now and then he thought of the Master as a great soul, but again he slighted
him as an ordinary human being. He spent much of his time in telling his beads, and he
criticized Rākhāl and the other young men for their indifference to the practice. He was a
strong advocate of religious conventions and rules of conduct, and made a fad of them.
He was about thirty-eight years old.
As Hazra came in, the Master became a little abstracted and in that mood began to talk.
MASTER (to Hazra): "What you are doing is right in principle, but the application is not
quite correct. Don't find fault with anyone, not even with an insect. As you pray to God
for devotion, so also pray that you may not find fault with anyone."
HAZRA: "Does God listen to our prayer for bhakti?"
MASTER: "Surely. I can assure you of that a hundred times. But the prayer must be
genuine and earnest. Do worldly-minded people weep for God as they do for wife and
children? At Kamarpukur the wife of a certain man fell ill. The man thought she would
not recover; he began to tremble and was about to faint. Who feels that way for God?"
Hazra was about to take the dust of the Master's feet.
MASTER (shrinking): "What is this?"
HAZRA: "Why should I not take the dust of his feet who has so kindly kept me with
him?"
MASTER: "Satisfy God and everyone will be satisfied.'If He is pleased the world is
pleased.' Once the Lord ate a few greens from Draupadi's cooking-pot and said, 'Ah, I
am satisfied.' Immediately the whole world and all its living beings were satisfied; they
felt as if they had eaten their fill. But was the world satisfied or did it feel that way when
the rishis ate their food?
591(To Hazra) "A perfect soul, even after attaining Knowledge, practises devotions or
observes religious ceremonies to set an example to others. I go to the Kāli temple and I
bow before the holy pictures in my room; therefore others do the same. Further, if a
man has become habituated to such ceremonies, he feels restless if he does not observe
them.
"One day I saw a sannyasi under the banyan-tree. He had put the salagram on the same
carpet with his guru's sandals. He was worshipping them. I said to him, 'If you have
attained Knowledge to that extent, then why such formal worship at all?' He replied:
'What difference does it make? Since I do everything else, why not this too? Sometimes
I offer the flowers at the guru's feet and sometimes to God.'
"One cannot renounce work as long as one has a body. As long as there is mud at the
bottom of the lake, bubbles will be produced.
Advice to Hazra - Scriptures and sadhana
(To Hazra) "If there is knowledge of one, there is also knowledge of many. What will you
achieve by mere study of the scriptures? The scriptures contain a mixture of sand and
sugar, as it were. It is extremely difficult to separate the sugar from the sand. Therefore
one should learn the essence of the scriptures from the teacher or from a sādhu.
Afterwards what does one care for books?
(To the devotees) "Gather all the information and then plunge in. Suppose a pot has
dropped in a certain part of a lake. Locate the spot and dive there.
"One should learn the essence of the scriptures from the guru and then practise
sadhana. If one rightly follows spiritual discipline, then one directly sees God. The
discipline is said to be rightly followed only when one plunges in. What will a man gain
by merely reasoning about the words of the scriptures? Ah, the fools! They reason
themselves to death over information about the path. They never take the plunge. What
a pity!
"You may say, even though you dive deep you are still in danger of sharks and
crocodiles, of lust and anger. But dive after rubbing your body with turmeric powder;
then sharks and crocodiles will not come near you. The turmeric is discrimination and
renunciation.
Master's spiritual practice
(To the devotees) "God made me pass through the disciplines of various paths. First
according to the Purana, then according to the Tantra. I also followed the disciplines of
the Vedas. At first I practised sadhana in the Panchavati. I made a grove of tulsi-plants
and used to sit inside it and meditate. Sometimes I cried with a longing Heart, 'Mother!
Mother!' Or I again, 'Rāma! Rāma!'
"While repeating the name of Rāma, I sometimes assumed the attitude of Hanuman and
fixed a tail to the lower end of my backbone. I was in a God-intoxicated state. At that
592time I used to put on a silk robe and worship the Deity. What joy I experienced in that
worship!
"I practised the discipline of the Tantra under the bel-tree. At that time I could see no
distinction between the sacred tulsi and any other plant. In that state I sometimes ate
the leavings from a jackal's meal, food that had been exposed the whole night, part of
which might have been eaten by snakes or other creatures. Yes, I ate that stuff.
"Sometimes I rode on a dog and fed him with luchi, also eating part of the bread myself.
I realized that the whole world was filled with God alone. One cannot have spiritual
realization without destroying ignorance; so I would assume the attitude of a tiger and
devour ignorance.
"While practising the disciplines of the Vedas, I became a sannyasi. I used to lie down in
the chandni and say to Hriday: 'I am a sannyasi. I shall take my meals here.'
"I vowed to the Divine Mother that I would kill myself if I did not see God. I said to Her:
'O Mother, I am a fool. Please teach me what is contained in the Vedas, the Puranas, the
Tantras, and the other scriptures.' The Mother said to me, 'The essence of the Vedānta is
that Brahman alone is real and the world illusory.'The Satchidananda Brahman described
in the Vedas is the Satchidananda Śiva of the Tantra and the Satchidananda Krishna of
the Purana. The essence of the Gitā is what you get by repeating the word ten times. It
is reversed into 'tagi', which indicates renunciation.
"After the realization of God, how far below lie the Vedas, the Vedānta, the Purana, the
Tantra! (To Hazra) I cannot utter the word 'Om' in samādhi. Why is that? I cannot say
'Om' unless I come down very far from the state of samādhi.
"I had all the experiences that one should have, according to the scriptures, after one's
direct perception of God. I behaved like a child, like a madman, like a ghoul, and like an
inert thing.
"I saw the visions described in the scriptures. Sometimes I saw the universe filled with
sparks of fire. Sometimes I saw all the quarters glittering with light, as if the world were
a lake of mercury. Sometimes I saw the world as if made of liquid silver. Sometimes,
again, I saw all the quarters illumined as if with the light of Raman candles. So you see
my experiences tally with those described in the scriptures.
"It was revealed to me further that God Himself has become the universe and all its
living beings and the twenty-four cosmic principles. It is like the process of evolution and
involution.
"Oh, what a state God kept me in at that time! One experience would hardly be over
before another overcame me. It was like the movement of the husking-machine: no
sooner is one end down than the other goes up.
593"I would see God in meditation, in the state of samādhi, and I would see the same God
when my mind came back to the outer world. When looking at this side of the mirror I
would see Him alone, and when looking on the reverse side I saw the same God."
The devotees listened to these words with rapt attention.
(To the Mukherji brothers) "Captain is now really in the state of the sadhaka. That the
mere possession of wealth should create, attachment is by no means true. Sambhu
Mallick used to say to Hriday, 'Hridu, I have packed my things and am ready for the
journey.' I said to him: 'God forbid! Why do you say such ominous words?' 'No', replied
Sambhu. 'Please bless me that I may cast aside all these possessions and go to God.'
"God's devotees have nothing to fear. They are His own He always stands by them. Once
Duryodhana and his brothers were imprisoned by the gandharvas. It was Yudhisthira
who freed them. Yudhisthira said, 'If our relatives are placed in such a plight, then it is
our disgrace.' "
It was about nine o'clock in the evening. The Mukherji brothers were ready to return to
Calcutta. The Master left his seat and began to pace the room and the porch. He could
hear the kirtan sung in the Vishnu temple. A devotee said that Harish and Lātu were in
the singing party.
Sri Ramakrishna and the devotees went to the Vishnu temple and saluted the Deity. The
brahmins belonging to the staff of the temple garden, and also the priests, the cooks,
and the servants, were singing the kirtan. He stood there a few minutes and encouraged
the singers. On the way back to his room he remarked to the devotees, "You see, some
of them polish the metal utensils and some go to houses of prostitution."
The Master returned to his room and took his seat. Presently the singers came and
bowed low before him. The Master said to them: "One should perspire, dancing and
singing the name of God, as people do earning money. I had thought of joining you in
the dancing; but I found that you did everything very well. You had flavoured the curry
with all the seasoning. What could I add? It will be nice if you sing devotional songs that
way now and then."
The Mukherji brothers saluted the Master. Their carriage was ready near the verandah
north of the room. The Master stood facing the north. On his left was the Ganges; in
front of him were the nahabat, the garden, and the kuthi; and to his right was the road
leading to the gate. The night was dark, and a devotee had brought a lantern to show
the visitors their way. One by one the devotees bowed and took the dust of the Master's
feet. The carriage seemed too heavily loaded for the horses. The Master said, "Aren't
there too many people in the carriage?"
Sri Ramakrishna remained standing. As the carriage rolled away, the devotees looked
back at the Master's face beaming with compassion and love.
594Sunday, September 21, 1884
A large number of devotees were in Sri Ramakrishna's room, among them Ram,
Mahendra Mukherji, M., and Chunilal. Chunilal had just returned from Vrindāvan, where
he had gone with Rākhāl and Balarām. The two latter were still there. Nityagopal also
was staying there. The Master began to talk with Chunilal about Vrindāvan.
MASTER: "How is Rākhāl?"
CHUNI: "He is quite well now, sir."
MASTER: "Isn't Nityagopal coming back?"
CHUNI: "He was still there when I left."
MASTER: "Who will bring your family back?"
CHUNI: "Balarām Babu told me he would arrange it with some reliable person. He didn't
mention any name."
Master praises Narayan
Sri Ramakrishna then spoke to Mahendra Mukherji about Narayan, a school-boy sixteen
or seventeen years old, who often visited the Master and was very dear to him.
MASTER: "He is quite guileless, isn't he?"
The very uttering of the word "guileless" filled the Master with great joy.
MAHENDRA: "Yes, sir. Completely guileless."
MASTER: "His mother came here the other day. I was a little frightened to see that she
was a proud woman. That day she found that Captain, you, and many others, too,
visited me. Then she must have realized that she and her son were not the only people
to come here. (All laugh.) There was some sugar candy in the room and she remarked
that it was good. That made her feel there was no scarcity of food here. I happened to
tell Baburam, in front of her, to keep some sweets for himself and Naran. Ganu's mother
said that Naran always bothered his mother for the boat hire to come here. His mother
said to me, 'Please ask Naran to consent to marry.' I replied, 'All that depends on one's
fate.' Why should I interfere? (All laugh.) Naran is indifferent to his studies. His mother
said, 'Please ask him to pay a little more attention.' So I said to Naran, 'Attend to your
studies.' Then his mother said, 'Please tell him seriously.' (All laugh.)
(To Chunilal) "Why doesn't Gopal come here?"
CHUNILAL: "He has been suffering from dysentery."
MASTER: "Is he taking any medicine?"
595Sri Ramakrishna was planning to go to a performance of the Chaitanyalila at the Star
Theatre. Mahendra Mukherji was to take him to Calcutta in his carriage. They were
talking about choosing good seats. Some suggested that one could see the performance
well from the one-rupee gallery. Ram said, "Oh, no! I shall engage a box for him." The
Master laughed. Some of the devotees said that public women took part in the play.
They took the parts of Nimai, Nitai, and others.
MASTER (to the devotees): "I shall look upon them as the Blissful Mother Herself. What
if one of them acts the part of Chaitanya? An imitation custard-apple reminds one of the
real fruit. Once, while going along a road, a devotee of Krishna noticed some babla-
trees. Instantly his mind was thrown into ecstasy. He remembered that the wood of
babla-trees was used for the handles of the spades that the garden of the temple of
Syamasundar was dug with. The trees instantly reminded him of Krishna. I was once
taken to the Maidan in Calcutta to see a balloon go up. There I noticed a young English
boy leaning against a tree, with his body bent in three places. It at once brought before
me the vision of Krishna and I went into samādhi.
"Once Chaitanyadeva was passing through a village. Someone told him that the body of
the drum used in the kirtan was made from the earth of that village, and at once he
went into ecstasy.
"Radha could not control herself at the sight of a cloud or the blue throat of a peacock. It
would at once awaken in her mind the thought of Krishna, and she would go into
ecstasy."
The Master was silent a few moments and then resumed the conversation.
MASTER: "Radha had attained mahabhava. There was no desire behind the ecstatic love
of the gopis. A true lover does not seek anything from God. He prays only for pure love.
He doesn't want any powers or miracles.
Occult powers
"It is very troublesome to possess occult powers. Nangta taught me this by a story. A
man who had acquired occult powers was sitting on the seashore when a storm arose. It
caused him great discomfort; so he said, 'Let the storm stop.' His words could not
remain unfulfilled. At that moment a ship was going full sail before the wind. When the
storm ceased abruptly the ship capsized and sank. The passengers perished and the sin
of causing their death fell to the man. And because of that sin he lost his occult powers
and went to hell.
"Once upon a time a sādhu acquired great occult powers. He was vain about them. But
he was a good man and had some austerities to his credit. One day the Lord, disguised
as a holy man, came to him and said, 'Revered sir, I have heard that you have great
occult powers.' The sādhu received the Lord cordially and offered him a seat. Just then
an elephant passed by. The Lord, in the disguise of the holy man, said to the sādhu,
'Revered sir, can you kill this elephant if you like?' The sādhu said, 'Yes, it is possible.'
596So saying, he took a pinch of dust, muttered some mantras over it, and threw it at the
elephant. The beast struggled awhile in pain and then dropped dead. The Lord said:
'What power you have! You have killed the elephant!' The sādhu laughed. Again the Lord
spoke: 'Now can you revive the elephant?' 'That too is possible', replied the sādhu. He
threw another pinch of charmed dust at the beast. The elephant writhed about a litle and
came back to life. Then the Lord said: 'Wonderful is your power. But may I ask you one
thing? You have killed the elephant and you have revived it. But what has that done for
you? Do you feel uplifted by it? Has it enabled you to realize God?' Saying this the Lord
vanished.
"Subtle are the ways of dharma. One cannot realize God if one has even the least trace
of desire. A thread cannot pass through the eye of a needle if it has the smallest fibre
sticking out.
"Krishna said to Arjuna, 'Friend, if you want to realize Me, you will not succeed if you
have even one of the eight occult powers.' This is the truth. Occult power is sure to
beget pride, and pride makes one forget God.
"Once a cross-eyed rich man came here. He said to me: 'You are a paramahamsa. That
is good. You must perform a swastyayana ceremony for me.' What a small-minded
person he was! He called me a paramahamsa and yet wanted me to perform that
ceremony. To secure welfare by means of the swastyayana is to exercise occult power.
"An egotistic person cannot realize God. Do you know what egotism is like? It is like a
high mound, where rain-water cannot collect: the water runs off. Water collects in low
land. There seeds sprout and grow into trees. Then the trees bear fruit.
"Therefore I say to Hazra, 'Never think that you alone have true understanding and that
others are fools.' One must love all. No one is a stranger. It is Hari alone who dwells in
all beings. Nothing exists without Him.
"The Lord said to Prahlada, 'Ask a boon of Me.' 'I have seen You', replied Prahlada. 'That
is enough. I don't need anything else.' But the Lord insisted. Thereupon Prahlada said, 'If
You must give me a boon, let it be that those who have tortured me may not have to
suffer punishment.' The meaning of those words is that it was God who tortured
Prahlada in the form of his persecutors, and, if they suffered punishment, it would really
be God who suffered.
Divine madness
"Radha was mad with prema, ecstatic love of God. But there is also the madness of
bhakti. Hanuman's was such. When he saw Sita entering the fire he was going to kill
Rāma. Then, too, there is the madness of Knowledge. I once saw a Jnāni behaving like a
madman. He came here very soon after the temple garden was dedicated. People said
he belonged to the Brahmo Sabha of Rammohan Roy. He had a torn shoe on one foot, a
stick in one hand, and a potted mango-plant in the other. After a dip in the Ganges he
went to the Kāli temple where Haladhāri was seated. With great fervour he began to
597chant a hymn to the Divine Mother. Then he went up to a dog, held it by the ear, and
ate some of its food. The dog didn't mind. Just at that time I too was about to
experience the state of divine madness. I threw my arm around Hriday's neck and said,
'Oh, Hride! Shall I too fall into that plight?'
Master's God-intoxicated condition
"I became mad. Narayan Shastri came here and saw me roaming about with a bamboo
pole on my shoulder. He said to the people, 'Ah, he is mad!' In that state I could not
observe any caste restrictions. The wife of a low caste man used to send me cooked
greens, and I ate them.
"I touched my head and lips with the leaf-plates from which the beggars ate their food in
the guest-house of the Kāli temple. Thereupon Haladhāri said to me: 'What have you
done? You have taken the food left by beggars. How will you marry off your children?'
These words aroused my anger. Haladhāri was my cousin, older than myself. But could
that restrain me? I said to him: 'You wretch! Isn't it you who take pride in the study of
the Gitā and the Vedānta? Isn't it you who teach people that Brahman alone is real and
the world illusory? And yet you imagine that I shall beget children! May your mouth that
recites from the Gitā be blighted!'
(To M.) "You see, mere study of books avails nothing. One may recite the written part
for the drum glibly from memory, but to play the drum is exceedingly difficult."
The Master continued with the description of his divine madness:
"Once, for a few days, I was out on an excursion with Mathur Babu in his house-boat.
We took the trip for a change of air. During that trip we visited Navadvip. One day I saw
the boatmen cooking their meal and stood and watched them. Mathur said to me, 'What
are you doing there?' I replied with a smile, 'The boatmen are cooking, and their food
looks very good.' Mathur felt that I might ask the boatmen to give me a portion of their
food; so he said: 'Come away! Come away!'
"But I cannot do such a thing now. I am no longer in that mood. Now the food must be
cooked by a brahmin observing ceremonial purity, and be offered to the Deity; then only
can I eat it.
"Oh, what moods I passed through! At Kamarpukur I said to Chine Sankhari and the
other chums of my boyhood days, 'Oh, I fall at your feet and beg of you to utter the
name of Hari.' I was about to prostrate myself before them all. Thereupon Chine said,
'This is the first outburst of your divine love; so you don't see any distinction between
one man and another.' When the storm breaks and raises the dust, then mango and
tamarind trees look the same. One cannot distinguish the one from the other."
A DEVOTEE: "How can a householder keep on with his worldly duties if he is
overwhelmed by such bhakti-madness or Love-madness or Knowledge madness?"
598Two kinds of yogis
MASTER (looking at him): "There are two kinds of yogis, the 'revealed' and the 'hidden'.
The householder may be a 'hidden' yogi. None recognizes him. The householder should
renounce mentally, not outwardly."
RAM: "You talk as if you were consoling children. A householder may be a Jnāni but
never a vijnāni."
MASTER: "He may become a vijnāni in the end. But it is not good to force oneself into
renunciation."
RAM: "Keshab Sen used to say: 'Why do people go to him so much? One day he will
sting them and they will flee from him.' "
MASTER: "Why should I sting people? I say to people: 'Do this as well as that. Do your
worldly duties and call on God as well.' I don't ask them to renounce everything. (With a
smile) One day Keshab was delivering a lecture. He said, 'O Lord, grant us that we may
dive into the river of divine love and go straight to the Ocean of Satchidananda.' The
ladies were seated behind the screen. I said to Keshab, 'How can you all dive once for
all?' Pointing to the ladies, I said: 'Then what would happen to them? Every now and
then you must return to dry land. You must dive and rise alternately.' Keshab and the
others laughed.
"Hazra says to me, 'You love most those endowed with rajas, those who have great
wealth and name and fame.' If that is so, then why do I love people like Harish and
Loto? Why do I love Narendra? He can't even afford salt to season his roast banana!"
Sri Ramakrishna left his from and went toward the pine-grove talking with M. A devotee
followed them with water and towel. The Master was talking about his intended visit to
the Star Theatre. He said to M.: "What Ram says applies to rajasic people. What is the
use of reserving an expensive seat?"
About five o'clock that afternoon Sri Ramakrishna was on his way to Calcutta. M.,
Mahendra Mukherji, and a few other devotees accompanied him in Mahendra's carriage.
Thinking of God, the Master soon went into an ecstatic mood. After a long time he
regained consciousness of the world. He observed: "That fellow Hazra dares teach me!
The rascal!" After a short pause he said, "shall drink some water." He often made such
remarks in order to bring his mind down to the sense plane.
MAHENDRA (to M.): "May I get some refreshments for him?"
M: "No, he won't eat anything now."
MASTER (still in ecstatic mood): "I shall eat."
599Mahendra took the Master to his flour-mill located at Hathibagan. After a little rest Sri
Ramakrishna was to go to the theatre. Mahendra did not care to take him to his own
house, for the Master was not well acquainted with his father. Priyanath, Mahendra's
second brother, was also a devotee of the Master.
Sri Ramakrishna was sitting on a cot over which a carpet had been spread, and was
engaged in spiritual talk.
MASTER (to M. and the others): "Once, while listening to the various incidents of the life
of Chaitanya, Hazra said that these were manifestations of Śakti, and that Brahman, the
All-pervasive Spirit, had nothing to do with them. But can there be Śakti without
Brahman? Hazra wants to nullify the teachings of this place.
Identity of Brahman and Śakti
"I have realized that Brahman and Śakti are identical, like water and its wetness, like fire
and its power to burn. Brahman dwells in all beings as the Bibhu, the All-pervasive
Consciousness, though Its manifestation is greater in some places than in others. Hazra
says, further, that anyone who realizes God must also acquire God's supernatural
powers; that he possesses these powers, though he may or may not use them."
M: "Yes, one must have control over these supernatural powers!" (All laugh)
MASTER (smiling): "Yes, one must have them in one's grasp! How mean! He who has
never enjoyed power and riches becomes impatient for them. But a true devotee never
prays to God for them."
Sri Ramakrishna washed his face. A smoke was prepared for him. He said to M.: "Is. it
dusk now? If it is, I won't smoke. During the twilight hour of the dusk you should give up
all other activities and remember God." Saying this he looked at the hairs on his arm. He
wanted to see whether he could count them. If he could not, it would be dusk.
Master at Star Theatre
About half past eight in the evening the carriage with the Master and the devotees drew
up in front of the Star Theatre on Beadon Street. He was accompanied by M., Baburam,
Mahendra and two or three others. They were talking about engaging seats, when Girish
Chandra Ghosh, the manager of the theatre, accompanied by several officials, came out
to the carriage, greeted the Master, and took him and the party upstairs. Girish had
heard of the Master and was very glad to see him at the theatre. The Master was
conducted to one of the boxes. M. sat next to him; Baburam and one or two devotees
sat behind.
The hall was brilliantly lighted. The Master looked down at the pit and saw that it was
crowded. The boxes also were full. For every box there was a man to fan those who
occupied it. Sri Ramakrishna was filled with joy and said to M., with his childlike smile:
"Ah, it is very nice here! I am glad to have come. I feel inspired when I see so many
people together. Then I clearly perceive that God Himself has become everything."
600M: "It is true, sir."
MASTER: "How much will they charge us here?"
M: "They won't take anything. They are very happy that you have come to the theatre."
MASTER: "It is all due to the grace of the Divine Mother."
The Chaitanyalila was about to be performed. It was a play about the early life of Sri
Chaitanya, who was also known as Nimai, Gaur, Gora, and Gaurānga. The curtain rose;
the attention of the audience was fixed on the stage.
The first scene depicts a council of Sin and the Six Passions. On a forest path behind
them walk Viveka, Vairāgya, and Bhakti, engaged in conversation.
Bhakti says to her companions: "Gaurānga is born in Nadia. Therefore the vidyadharis,
the munis, and the rishis have come down to earth in disguise to pay their respects to
him."
She sings:
Blest indeed is the earth! Gora is born in Nadia!
Behold the vidyadharis, coming in chariots toadore him;
Behold the munis and rishis, who come, allured by the spell of Love.
The vidyadharis, munis, and rishis sing a hymn to Gaurānga and adore him as
an Incarnation of God.
Sri Ramakrishna watched the scene and was overpowered with divine ecstasy. He said to
M.: "Look at it! Ah! Ah!"
Sages: O Kesava, bestow Thy grace
Upon Thy luckless servants here!
O Kesava, who dost delight
To roam Vrindāvan's glades and groves!
Goddesses: O Madhava, our mind's Bewitcher!
Sweet One, who dost steal our hearts,
Sweetly playing On Thy flute!
Chorus: Chant, O mind, the name of Hari,
Sing aloud the name of Hari,
Praise Lord Hari's name!
Sages: O Thou Eternal Youth of Braja,
Tamer of fierce Kaliya,
Slayer of the afflicted's fear!
601Goddesses: Beloved with the arching eyes
And crest with arching peacock feather,
Charmer of Sri Radha's heart!
Sages: Govardhan's mighty Lifter, Thou,
All garlanded with sylvan flowers!
O Damodara, Kamsa's Scourge!
Goddesses: O Dark One, who dost sport in bliss
With sweet Vrindāvan's gopi maids.
Chorus: Chant, O mind, the name of Hari,
Sing aloud the name of Hari,
Praise Lord Hari's name!
As the vidyadharis sang the lines, Beloved with the arching eyes; And crest with arching
peacock feather!, the Master went into deep samādhi. The orchestra played on, but he
was not aware of the outer world.
Another scene: A guest has arrived at the house of Jagannath Misra, Nimai's father. The
boy Nimai plays about, singing with his friends, in a happy mood:
Tell Me, where is My blessed Vrindāvan?
Where is Mother Yaśoda?
Where Father Nanda and Brother Balai?
Where My twin cows, black and white?
Tell Me, where is My magic flute?
My friends Sudāmā and Sridāmā?
Where My Jamuna's bank, My banyan?
Where My beloved gopi maids?
Where is Radha, queen of My heart?
The guest closes his eyes while offering food to the Lord. Nimai runs to him. and eats the
food from the plate. The guest recognizes Nimai as an Incarnation of God and seeks to
please him with the Hymn of the Ten Incarnations. Before taking leave of Gaurānga's
parents he sings:
Glory to Gora, the Source of Bliss!
Hail Gaurānga, Redeemer of earth!
Help of the helpless, Life of the living,
Slayer of fear in the hearts of the fearful!
Age after age we see Thy play
New sports unfolding, moods ever new;
New waves rolling, new tales to be told.
Thou who bearest the whole world's burden,
Shower on us the nectar of Love!
Take away our grief and affliction:
602Thou in Love's pleasure-cave dost dwell.
Hope of the suffering! Chastiser of sin!
Scourge of the wicked! Victory to Thee!
Listening to the hymn, the Master was thrilled with ecstasy.
The next scene is at Navadvip on the bank of the Ganges. After bathing in the holy
water, the brahmin men and women engage in worship by the riverside. As they close
their eyes, Nimai steals their food offerings and begins to eat them. A brahmin loses his
temper and says: "You scapegrace! You rascal! You are taking away my offering for
Vishnu. Ruin will seize you." Nimai holds on to the offering and is about to run away.
Many of the women love him dearly and cannot bear to have him go away. They call to
him: "Return, O Nimai! Come back, O Nimai!" Nimai turns a deaf ear to them.
One of the women, however, knows the irresistible charm that will bring him back. She
loudly chants the name of Hari. Immediately he repeats the name of Hari and comes
back.
M. was seated beside the Master. Sri Ramakrishna could not control himself. He cried
out, "Ah!" and shed tears of love. He said to Baburam and M.: "Don't make a fuss if I fall
into an ecstatic mood or go into samādhi. Then the worldly people will take me for a
cheat."
Another scene: Nimai is invested with the sacred thread of the brahmins. He puts on the
traditional ochre robe of the sannyasi. Mother Sachi and the women of the
neighbourhood stand about while he begs for alms, singing:
Drop a morsel of food, I pray, into my begging bowl;
Alone I roam, a new-made yogi, on the highways of the world.
People of Braja, you I love, and so, time and again,
I come to you; at hunger's call I beg my food from door to
door.
The sun is low, and I must seek my home on the Jamuna's bank;
Into its waters fall my tears, as onward murmuring it flows.
The onlookers leave the stage. Nimai stands alone. The gods, in the guise of brahmin
men and women, sing his praises.
Thy body gleams like liquid moonlight;
Thou hast put on man's dwarfish form.
O Lord, Thee we salute!
Men:
Women: Bewitcher of the gopis' hearts,
Thou roamest in the shady groves
About Vrindāvan's vale.
603Nimai: Hail Sri Radha! Glory to Radha!
The youths of Braja are Thy friends;
Thou curbest haughty Madan's pride.
Women: Thy love has made the gopis mad;
In ecstasy the Jamuna thrills.
Men: Narayana, Deluder of demons!
Refuge of the fear-stricken gods!
Women: O Lover of Braja, Thou dost beg
The love of Braja's comely maidens!
Nimai: Hail Sri Radha! Glory to Radha!
Listening to the music, the Master went into samādhi. The curtain fell and the orchestra
played on.
A new scene: Srivas and other devotees are engaged in conversation in front of
Advaita's house. Mukunda sings:
Sleep no more! How long will you lie
In māyā's slumber locked, O mind?
Who are you? Why have you been born?
Forgotten is your own true Self.
O mind, unclose your eyes at last
And wake yourself from evil dreams;
A fool you are to bind yourself
So to the passing shows of life,
When in you lives Eternal Bliss.
Come out of the gloom, O foolish mind!
Come out and hail the rising Sun!
Sri Ramakrishna praised the voice of the singer highly.
Another scene: Nimai is staying at home. Srivas comes to visit him. First he meets
Sachi. The mother weeps and says: "My son doesn't attend to his household duties. My
eldest son, Viswarupa, has renounced the world, and my heart has ached ever since.
Now I fear that Nimai will follow in his steps."
Nimai arrives. Sachi says to Srivas: "Look at him. Tears run down his cheeks and breast.
Tell, tell me how I can free him from these notions."
At the sight of Srivas, Nimai clings to his feet and says, with eyes full of tears: "Ah me!
Revered sir, I have not yet attained devotion to Krishna. Futile is this wretched life! Tell
me, sir, where is Krishna? Where shall I find Krishna? Give me the dust of your feet with
604your blessing, that I may realize the Blue One with the garland of wild-flowers hanging
about His neck."
Sri Ramakrishna looked at M. He was eager to say something but he could not. His voice
was choked with emotion; the tears ran down his cheeks; with unmoving eyes he
watched Nimai clinging to Srivas's feet and saying, "Sir, I have not yet attained devotion
to Krishna."
Nimai has opened a school, but he cannot teach the students any longer. Gangadas, his
former teacher, comes to persuade him to direct his attention to his worldly duties. He
says to Srivas: "Listen, Srivas! We are brahmins, too, and devoted to the worship of
Vishnu. But you people are ruining Nimai's worldly prospects."
MASTER (to M.): "That is the advice of the worldly-wise: Do 'this' as well as 'that'. When
the worldly man teaches spirituality he always advises a compromise between the world
and God."
M: "Yes, sir. That is true."
Gangadas continues his argument with Nimai. He says: "Nimai, undoubtedly you are
versed in the scriptures. Reason with me. Explain to me if any other duty is superior to
worldly duties. You are a householder. Why disregard the duties of a householder and
follow others' duties?"
MASTER (to M.): "Did you notice? He's trying to persuade Nimai to make a compromise."
M: "Yes, sir."
Nimai says to Gangadas: "I am not wilfully indifferent to a householder's duties. On the
contrary, it is my desire to hold to all sides. But, revered sir, I don't know what it is that
draws me on. I don't know what to do. I want to cling to the shore but I cannot. My soul
wanders away. I am helpless. My soul constantly wants to plunge headlong into the
boundless Ocean."
MASTER: "Ah me!"
The scene changes: Nityananda has arrived at Navadvip. After a search he meets Nimai,
who, in turn, has been seeking him. When they meet, Nimai says to him: "Blessed is my
life! Fulfilled is my dream! You visited me in a dream and then disappeared."
The Master said in a voice choked with emotion, "Nimai said he had seen him in a
dream."
Nimai is in an ecstatic mood and becomes engaged in conversation with Advaita, Srivas,
Haridas, and other devotees. Nitai sings a song suited to Nimai's mood:
605Where is Krishna? Where is my Krishna?
He is not in the grove, dear friends.
Give me Krishna! Bring me my Krishna!
Radha's heart knows naught but Him.
At this song Sri Ramakrishna went into samādhi. He remained in that state a long time.
The orchestra played on. Gradually his mind came down to the relative plane. In the
mean time a young man of Khardaha, born in the holy family of Nityananda, had entered
the box. He was standing behind the Master's chair. Sri Ramakrishna was filled with
delight at the sight of him. He held his hand and talked to him affectionately. Every now
and then he said: "Please sit down here. Your very presence awakens my spiritual
feeling." He played tenderly with the young man's hands and lovingly stroked his face.
After he had left, Sri Ramakrishna said to M.: "He is a great scholar. His father is a great
devotee of God. When I go to Khardaha to visit Syamasundar, the father entertains me
with sacred offerings such as one cannot buy even for a hundred rupees. This young
man has good traits. A little shaking will awaken his inner spirit. At the sight of him my
spiritual mood is aroused. I should have been overwhelmed with ecstasy if he had stayed
here a little longer."
The curtain rises: Nityananda is walking in a procession on the public road with his
companions, chanting the name of Hari. He meets two ruffians, Jagai and Madhai, who
are sworn enemies of all religious people. Madhai strikes Nitai with a piece of broken
pottery. Nitai is hurt and bleeds profusely, but he pays no heed, inebriated as he is with
the love of God.
Sri Ramakrishna was in an ecstatic mood.
Nitai embraces both Jagai and Madhai, and sings a song to the two ruffians:
Jagai! Madhai! Oh, come and dance,
Chanting Hari's name with fervour!
What does it matter that you struck me?
Dance, dear friends, in Hari's name!
Sing the name of our Beloved:
He will embrace you in love's rapture!
Let the heavens resound with His name!
You have not tasted true emotion:
Weep as you chant the name of Hari,
And you will see the Moon of your soul.
Hari's name would I lovingly give you;
Nitai calls you to share His love.
Nimai speaks to Sachi of his desire to enter the monastic life. His mother faints and falls
to the ground.

At this point many in the audience burst into tears. Sri Ramakrishna remained still and looked intently at the stage. A single tear appeared in the corner of each eye. The performance was over.

Sri Ramakrishna was about to enter a carriage. A devotee asked him how he had enjoyed the play. The Master said with a smile, "I found the representation the same as
the real." 

The carriage proceeded toward Mahendra's mill. Suddenly, Sri Ramakrishna went into an ecstatic mood and murmured to himself in loving tones: "O Krishna! O Krishna! Krishna is knowledge! Krishna is soul! Krishna is mind! Krishna is life! Krishna is body!" He
continued: "O Govinda, Thou art my life! Thou art my soul!"

The carriage reached the mill. Mahendra fed the Master tenderly with various dishes. M. sat by his side. Affectionately he said to M., "Here, eat a little." He put some sweets in his hands.

With Mahendra and a few other devotees, Sri Ramakrishna left in the carriage for the Dakshineswar temple garden. The Master was in a happy mood. He sang a song about
Gaurānga and Nitai. M. sang with him: 

Gaur and Nitai, ye blessed brothers!
I have heard how kind you are,
And therefore I have come to you. . .
The Master and Mahendra talked about the latter's intended pilgrimage.
MASTER (smiling): "The divine love in you is barely a sprout now. Why should you let it
wither? But come back very soon. Many a time I have thought of visiting your place. At
last I have done it. I am so happy."
MAHENDRA: "My life is indeed blessed, sir."
MASTER: "You were already blessed. Your father is also a good man. I saw him the other
day. He has faith in the Adhyātma Rāmāyana."
MAHENDRA: "Please bless me that I may have love for God."
MASTER: "You are generous and artless. One cannot realize God without sincerity and
simplicity. God is far, far away from the crooked heart."
Near Syambazar, Mahendra bade the Master good-bye, and the carriage continued on its
way.
