## The 3 Gunas

Under the spell of God's maya man forgets his true nature.

He forgets that he is heir to the infinite glories of his Father. This divine maya is made up of 3 gunas. 

And all 3 are robbers. They rob man of all his treasures and make him forget his true nature. 

The 3 gunas are:

1. Sattva
2. Rajas
3. Tamas

Of these, sattva alone points the way to God. But even sattva cannot take a man to God.



## Parable of the three robbers

Once a rich man was robbed by 3 robbers.

`Robber 1` said: 'What's the good of keeping the man alive? Kill him.' 
- This is tamas. It destroys.
`Robber 2` said: 'There's no use in killing him. Let us bind him and leave him here. Then he won't be able to tell the police.' They left. 
- This is rajas, which binds a man to the world and entangles him in a variety of activities. Rajas makes him forget God.
`Robber 3` returned to the rich man and said: 'You're badly hurt. I will release you. Follow that road and you will reach home easily.'

<!--  The third robber set the man free and led him out of the forest. When .they came near the highway, the robber said, '' 'But you must come with me too', said the man.
'You have done so much for me. We shall all be happy to see you at our home.' 
'No,'  said the robber, 'it is not possible for me to go there. The police will arrest me.' -->

- This is Sattva which alone shows the way to God. It produces virtues like compassion, righteousness, and devotion.
- Sattva is like the last step of the stairs. Next to it is the roof.

The Supreme Brahman is man's own abode. One cannot attain the Knowledge of Brahman unless one transcends the three gunas.


<!-- MASTER (with a smile): " -->

Do you know the nature of devotees? 

When one devotee meets another, he says, 'Let me speak and you listen; and when you speak I shall listen.' 

You are a preacher and teach so many people! You are a steamship, and I am a mere fishing-boat.' 

(All laugh.)
