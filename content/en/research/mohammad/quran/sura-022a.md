{{< s v="1" >}} Be conscious of your Lord. The quaking of the Hour is a tremendous thing.

{{< s v="2" >}} On that Day:
- every nursing mother will discard her infant
- every pregnant woman will abort her load
- you will see the people drunk, even though they are not drunk

{{< s v="3" >}} Some person will argue about Allah without knowledge and follow every defiant devil.

{{< s v="4" >}} He will misguide his followers and lead them to the torment of the Blaze.

{{< s v="5" >}} Regarding the Resurrection:
- We created you from dust
- then from a small drop
- then from a clinging clot
- then from a lump of flesh, partly developed and partly undeveloped. 
- We settle in the wombs whatever We will for a designated term
- We then bring you out as infants, until you reach your full strength.
- Some of you will pass away
- some of you will be returned to the vilest age, so that he may not know, after having known. 

And you see the earth still; but when We send down water on it, it vibrates, and swells, and grows all kinds of lovely pairs.

{{< s v="6" >}} That is because Allah:
- gives life to the dead
- Capable of everything.

{{< s v="7" >}} The Hour is coming
- Allah will resurrect those in the graves.

{{< s v="8-9" >}} A misguider will lead away people from the path of Allah in contempt. 
<!-- 8. And among the people is he who argues
about Allah without knowledge, or guidance,
or an enlightening scripture. -->
- He will be humiliated in this world
- On Resurrection Day, We will make him taste the agony of burning.

{{< s v="10" >}} That is for what your hands have advanced, and because Allah is not unjust to the servants.

{{< s v="11" >}} Among the people is he who worships Allah on edge. When something good comes his way, he is content with it. But when an ordeal strikes him, he makes a turnaround. He loses this world and the next. That is the obvious loss.

{{< s v="12" >}} He invokes, instead of Allah, what can neither harm him nor benefit him. That is the far straying.

{{< s v="13" >}} He invokes one whose harm is closer than his benefit. What a miserable master. What a miserable companion.

{{< s v="14" >}} Allah will admit those who believe and do righteous deeds into Gardens beneath which rivers flow. 

{{< s v="15-16" >}} Whoever thinks that Allah will not help him in this life and in the Hereafter—let him turn to heaven, then sever, and see if his cunning eliminates what enrages him.

<!-- {{< s v="16" >}} Thus We revealed it as clarifying signs, and Allah guides whomever He wills. -->

{{< s v="17" >}} Allah will judge the following on the Day of Ressurrection:
- Those who believe
- The Jewish
- The Sabeans
- The Christians
- The Zoroastrians
- The Polytheists

{{< s v="18" >}}

<!-- 18. Do you not realize that to Allah prostrates everyone in the heavens and everyone on
earth, and the sun, and the moon, and the stars, and the mountains, and the trees, and
the animals, and many of the people? 

But many are justly deserving of punishment. Whomever Allah shames, there is none to
honor him. Allah does whatever He wills.  -->

19. Here are two adversaries feuding regarding their Lord. As for those who disbelieve, garments of fire will be tailored for them, and scalding water will be poured over their heads. 

20. Melting

21. Their insides and their skins.
they will have maces of iron.

Whenever they try to escape the gloom, they will be driven back to it: “Taste the suffering of burning.”

23. But Allah will admit those who believe and do good deeds into Gardens beneath which
rivers flow. They will be decorated therein with bracelets of gold and pearls, and their
garments therein will be of silk.

24. They were guided to purity of speech. They
were guided to the path of the Most Praised.
25. As for those who disbelieve and repel from
Allah’s path and from the Sacred Mosque—
which We have designated for all mankind
equally, whether residing therein or passing
through—and seek to commit sacrilege
therein—We will make him taste of a painful
punishment.
26. We showed Abraham the location of the
House: “Do not associate anything with Me;
and purify My House for those who circle
around, and those who stand to pray, and
those who kneel and prostrate.”
27. And announce the pilgrimage to human-
ity. They will come to you on foot, and on
every transport. They will come from every
distant point.
28. That they may witness the benefits for
themselves, and celebrate the name of Allah
during the appointed days, for providing
them with the animal livestock. So eat from
it, and feed the unfortunate poor.
29. Then let them perform their acts of cleans-
ing, and fulfill their vows, and circle around
the Ancient House.
30. All that. Whoever venerates the sanctities of Allah—it is good for him with his Lord. 

All livestock are permitted to you, except what is recited to you. So stay away from the abomination of idols, and stay away from perjury.

31. Being true to Allah, without associating anything with Him. Whoever associates any-
thing with Allah—it is as though he has fallen from the sky, and is snatched by the birds, or
is swept away by the wind to a distant abyss.
