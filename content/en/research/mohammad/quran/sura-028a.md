<!-- 1. Ta, Seen, Meem. -->{{< s v="2" >}}  This is the true history of Moses and Pharaoh.

{{< s v="4" >}}  Pharaoh exalted himself in the land, and divided its people into factions. He persecuted a group of them, slaughtering their sons, while sparing their daughters. He was truly a corrupter.

{{< s v="5-6" >}}  But We desired to favor those who were oppressed in the land. We wanted to:
- make them leaders and the inheritors
- establish them in the land
- show Pharaoh, Hamaan, and their troops, the very thing they feared.

<sup>7</sup> We inspired the mother of Moses:

{{< l a="Allah" >}}
Nurse him. Then, when you fear for him, cast him into the river, and do not fear, nor grieve; We will return him to you, and make him one of the messengers.
{{< /l >}}

8. Pharaoh’s household picked him up, to be an opponent and a sorrow for them. Pharaoh,
Hamaan, and their troops were sinners.

{{< s v="9" >}} 

{{< l a="Wife-of-Paraoh" >}}
An eye's delight for me and for you. Do not kill him. Perhaps he will be useful to us, or we may adopt him as a son.” 
{{< /l >}}

But they did not foresee.

{{< s v="10" >}}  The heart of Moses’ mother became vacant. She was about to disclose him, had We not steadied her heart, that she may remain a believer.

{{< s v="11" >}}  She said to his sister, “Trail him.” So she watched him from afar, and they were unaware.

12. We forbade him breastfeeding at first. So she said:

{{< l a="Wife-of-Paraoh" >}}
“Shall I tell you about a family that can raise him for you, and will look after him?
{{< /l >}}

13. Thus We returned him to his mother, that she may be comforted, and not grieve, and know that Allah’s promise is true. But most of them do not know. 

14. When he reached his maturity, and became established, We gave him wisdom and knowledge. Thus do We reward the virtuous.

<sup>15-21</sup>. He entered the city unnoticed. He found two men fighting:
- one of his own sect
- one from his enemies.

The one of his sect ask for his help. So Moses punched and killed his enemy.

{{< l a="Moses" >}}
This is of Satan's doing. He is an enemy that openly misleads.
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Sect-member" >}}
My Lord, I have wronged myself, so forgive me. In as much as you will favor me, I will never be a supporter of the criminals.
{{< /r >}}

So He forgave him. 

The next morning, he went around in the city, fearful and vigilant. The man who asked for his help the day before shouted to him. 

{{< l a="Moses" >}}
You are clearly a troublemaker.
{{< /l >}}

19. He was about to strike another one who was their enemy:

{{< r a="Enemy" >}}
Do you intend to kill me, as you killed someone yesterday? You only want to be a bully in the land, and do not want to be a peacemaker.
{{< /r >}}

20. A man came from the farthest part of the city running and said:

{{< r a="Man" >}}
Moses, the authorities are considering killing you, so leave. I am giving you good advice.
{{< /r >}}

21. So he left, fearful and vigilant. 

{{< l a="Moses" >}}
My Lord, deliver me from the wrongdoing people.
{{< /l >}}


22. As he headed towards Median, he said:

{{< l a="Moses" >}}
Perhaps my Lord will guide me to the right way.
{{< /l >}}

23. When he arrived at the waters of Median, he found people drawing water and two women waiting on the side. 

{{< l a="Moses" >}}
What is the matter with you?
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Women" >}}
We cannot draw water until the shepherds depart. Our father is a very old man.
{{< /r >}}


24. So he drew water for them, and then withdrew to the shade, and said:

{{< l a="Moses" >}}
My Lord, I am in dire need of whatever good you might send down to me.
{{< /l >}}


25. Then, one of the two women approached him, walking bashfully. She said:

{{< r a="Woman" >}}
My father is calling you, to reward you for drawing water for us.
{{< /r >}}

When he came to him, and told him the story, he said:

{{< r a="Old-man" >}}
Do not fear, you have escaped from the wrongdoing people.
{{< /r >}}

{{< r a="Woman" >}}
Father, hire him; the best employee for you is the strong and trustworthy.
{{< /r >}}

{{< r a="Old-man" >}}
I want to marry you to one of these two daughters of mine, provided you work for me for 8 years. But if you complete 10, that is up to you. I do not intend to impose any hardship on you. I am one of the righteous.
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Moses" >}}
Let this be an agreement between you and me. Whichever of the 2 terms I fulfill, there shall be no reprisal against me
{{< /l >}}

29. When Moses had completed the term, and departed with his family, he noticed a fire by the side of the Mount. 

He said to his family:

{{< l a="Moses" >}}
Stay here, I saw a fire. Perhaps I can bring you some information from there, or an ember from the fire, that you may warm yourselves.
{{< /l >}}

30. When he reached it, he was called from the right side of the valley, at the Blessed Spot, from the bush:


{{< r a="Allah" >}}
Moses, it is I, Allah, the Lord of the Worlds. Throw down your staff.
{{< /r >}}

When he saw it wiggling, as if it were possessed, he turned his back to flee, and did not look back.

{{< r a="Allah" >}}
O Moses, come forward, and do not fear, you are perfectly safe. Put your hand inside your pocket, and it will come out white, without blemish. Press your arm to your side, against fear. These are two proofs from your Lord, to Pharaoh and his dignitaries. They are truly sinful people.
{{< /r >}}

33-34 
{{< l a="Moses" >}}
My Lord, I have killed one of them, and I fear they will kill me. My brother Aaron is more eloquent than me. So send him with me, to help me, and to confirm my words, for I fear they will reject me.”
{{< /l >}}


35. 

{{< r a="Allah" >}}
We will strengthen your arm with your brother and give you authority so they will not touch you. By virtue of Our signs, you and those who follow you will be the triumphant.
{{< /r >}}

36. But when Moses came to them with Our signs, clear and manifest, they said:

{{< r a="Egyptians" >}}
This is nothing but fabricated magic, and We never heard of this from our ancestors.
{{< /r >}}

37
{{< l a="Moses" >}}
My Lord is aware of:
- him who brings guidance from Him, and 
- him who will have the sequel of the abode. The wrongdoers will not succeed.
{{< /l >}}


38. 

{{< r a="Pharaoh" >}}
O nobles, I know of no god for you other than me. So fire-up the bricks for me O Hamaan, and build me a tower, that I may ascend to the God of Moses, though I think he is a liar.
{{< /r >}}


39. He and his troops acted arrogantly in the land, with no justification. They thought they would not be returned to Us. 

40. So We seized him, and his troops, and We threw them into the sea. Observe, therefore, what was the end of the oppressors.

41. We made them leaders calling to the Fire. And on Resurrection Day, they will not be saved.

42. We pursued them in this world with a curse. And on Resurrection Day, they will be among the despised.
