<!-- 1. Ta, Seen, Meem. -->{{< s v="2" >}}  These are the Verses of the Clarifying Book.

{{< s v="3-9" >}}  Perhaps you will destroy yourself with grief, because they do not become believers.

{{< s v="10-14" >}} 

{{< l a="Allah" >}}
Go to the tyrannical people, the people of Pharaoh. Will they not fear?
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Moses" >}}
I fear they will rejectme. I become stressed, and my tongue is not fluent, so send Aaron too. They have a charge against me, so I fear they will kill me.
{{< /r >}}

15-16

{{< l a="Allah" >}}
No. Go, both of you, with Our proofs. We will be with you, listening. Go to Pharaoh, and say, ‘We are the Messengers of the Lord of the Worlds. Bring it, if you are being truthful.”
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Pharaoh" >}}
We raised you as a child among us. You stayed among us for many years. Yet you did what you did. You were ungrateful.
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Moses" >}}
I did it then, when I was of those astray. I fled from you when I feared you; but my Lord gave me wisdom, and made me one of the messengers. Is that the favor you taunt me with, although you have enslaved the Jews?”
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Pharaoh" >}}
What is the Lord of the Worlds?
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Moses" >}}
The Lord of the heavens and the earth, and everything between them, Your Lord and the Lord of your ancestors of old.
{{< /l >}}

<!-- [To the people around him:] Do you not hear ? -->

{{< r a="Pharaoh" >}}
You are crazy. If you accept any god other than me, I will imprison you.
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Moses" >}}
I will give you proof
{{< /l >}}

So he cast his staff and it became a serpent. He pulled his hand and it was white, for all to see.

{{< r a="Pharaoh" >}}
[To the dignitaries around him:] This is a skilled magician. He intends to drive you out of your land with his magic, so what do you advise?
{{< /r >}}


36

{{< r a="Dignitaries" >}}
Delay him and his brother, and send recruiters to the cities to gather magicians. 
{{< /r >}}

The magicians were gathered for the appointment on a specified day, along with the people to see who will win. 

{{< r a="Magicians" >}}
[To Pharaoh:] Is there a reward for us, if win?
{{< /r >}}

42

{{< r a="Pharaoh" >}}
Yes, you will be among those favored.
{{< /r >}}

43. Moses said to them, “Present what you intend to present.”

44. So they threw their ropes and their sticks, and said, “By the majesty of Pharaoh, we will be the winners.”

45. Then Moses threw his staff, and behold, it began swallowing their trickery.

The magicians fell down prostrating.

They said, “We have believed in the Lord of the Worlds. The Lord of Moses and Aaron.”

{{< r a="Pharaoh" >}}
Did you believe in Him before I have given you permission? He must be your chief, who taught you magic. I will cut off your hands and feet on opposite sides, and I will crucify you all.
{{< /r >}}

{{< r a="Magicians" >}}
No problem. To our Lord we will return. We are eager for our Lord to forgive us our sins, since we are the first of the believers.”
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Allah" >}}
[To Moses:] Travel with My servants by night. You will be followed.

He said, “Have you considered what you worship.

So We drove them out of gardens and

59. So it was. And We made the Children of
Israel inherit them.
60. And
they pursued them at sunrise.
When the two groups sighted each other,
the followers of Moses said, “We are being
overtaken.”
62. He said, “No; my Lord is with me, He will
guide me.”
63. We inspired Moses: “Strike the sea with
your staff.” Whereupon it parted, and each
part was like a huge hill.

64. And
there We brought the others near.
We saved Moses and those with him,
all together.

We drowned the others.

Day of the Reckoning.”
83. “My Lord! Grant me wisdom, and include
me with the righteous.
84. And give me a reputation of truth among
the others.
85. And make me of the inheritors of the Gar-
den of Bliss.
86. And forgive my father—he was one of the
misguided.
87. And do not disgrace me on the Day they
are resurrected.
88. The Day when neither wealth nor children

89. Except for him who comes to Allah with a
sound heart.”
90. And Paradise will be brought near for the
righteous.
91. And the Blaze will be displayed to the devi-
ators.
92. And it will be said to them, “Where are
those you used to worship?”
93. Besides Allah? Can they help you, or help
themselves?”
94. Then they will be toppled into it, together
with the seducers.

124. When their brother Hud said to them, “Do
one misled us except the sinners.
100. Now
you not fear?
we have no intercessors.
101. And
no sincere friend.
102. If only we could have another chance, we
would be among the faithful.”
103. Surely in this is a sign, but most of them
are not believers.
104. Your
Lord is the Almighty, the Merciful.
The people of Noah disbelieved the mes-
sengers.

am to you a faithful messenger.

109. I
110. So
fear Allah, and obey me.”
They said, “Shall we believe in you, when
it is the lowliest who follow you?”
112. He said, “What do I know about what they
do?
113. Their account rests only with my Lord, if
you have sense.
114. And I am not about to drive away the be-
lievers.
111.
115. I
am only a clear warner.”
said, “If you do not refrain, O Noah,
you will be stoned.”
117. He said, “My Lord, my people have denied
me.
118. So judge between me and them decisively,
and deliver me and the believers who are with
me.

128. Do you build a monument on every height
for vanity's sake?
129. And you set up fortresses, hoping to live
forever?
130. And when you strike, you strike merci-

I fear for you the punishment of an awe-
some Day.”
136. They said, “It is the same for us, whether
you lecture us, or do not lecture.
135.
137. This
is nothing but morals of the ancients.
138. And
we will not be punished.”
So they denied him, and We destroyed
them. Surely in this is a sign, but most of
them are not believers.
139.
140. Your
Lord is the Almighty, the Merciful.
141. Thamood
disbelieved the messengers.
When their brother Saleh said to them,
“Do you not fear?
142.
143. I

144. So

do not obey the command of the ex-
travagant.
152. Who spread turmoil on earth, and do not
reform.”
153. They said, “You are surely one of the be-
witched.
154. You are nothing but a man like us. So
bring us a sign, if you are truthful.
155. He said, “This is a she-camel; she has her
turn of drinking, and you have your turn of
drinking—on a specified day.
156. And do not touch her with harm, lest the
punishment of a great day seizes you.”
157. But they slaughtered her, and became full
of remorse.
158. So the punishment overtook them. Surely
in this is a sign, but most of them are not be-
lievers.
151. And
159. Your

people of Lot disbelieved the messen-
gers.
161. When their brother Lot said to them, “Do
you not fear?
162. I
am to you a faithful messenger.
163. So
fear Allah, and obey me.
I ask of you no payment for it. My pay-
ment is only from the Lord of the Worlds.
164.
165. Do
you approach the males of the world?
And forsake the wives your Lord created
for you? Indeed, you are intrusive people.”
167. They said, “Unless you refrain, O Lot, you
will be expelled.”
168. He said, “I certainly deplore your con-
duct.”
169. “My Lord, save me and my family from
what they do.”
170. So We saved him and his family, alto-
gether.
166.
Except for an old woman among those
who tarried.
We destroyed the others.
And We rained down on them a rain.
Dreadful is the rain of those forewarned.
174. Surely in this is a sign, but most of them
are not believers.
173.
175. Your
Lord is the Almighty, the Merciful.
The People of the Woods disbelieved the
messengers.
177. When Shuaib said to them, “Do you not
fear?
176.
178. I
am to you a trustworthy messenger.
179. So
fear Allah, and obey me.
I ask of you no payment for it. My pay-
ment is only from the Lord of the Worlds.
180.
181. Give
full measure, and do not cheat.
182. And
weigh with accurate scales.
And do not defraud people of their be-
longings, and do not work corruption in the
land.
184. And fear Him who created you and the
masses of old.”
185. They said, “You are one of those be-
witched.
186. And you are nothing but a man like us;
and we think that you are a liar.
187. So bring down on us pieces from the sky,
if you are truthful.”
188. He said, “My Lord is Well Aware of what
you do.”
189. But they denied him. So the punishment
of the day of gloom gripped them. It was the
punishment of a great day.
190. Surely in this is a sign, but most of them
are not believers.
183.
191. Your
Lord is the Almighty, the Merciful.
It is a revelation from the Lord of the
Worlds.

Honest Spirit came down with it.27. THE ANT (an-Naml)

196. And
it is in the scriptures of the ancients.
197. Is it not a sign for them that the scholars
of the Jews recognized it?
198. Had We revealed it to one of the foreign-
ers.
199. And he had recited it to them, they still
would not have believed in it.
200. Thus We make it pass through the hearts
of the guilty.
201. They will not believe in it until they wit-
ness the painful punishment.
202. It will come to them suddenly, while they
are unaware.
203. Then they will say, “Are we given any res-
pite?”
they seek to hasten Our punishment?
We let them enjoy
themselves for some years.
206. Then there comes to them what they were
promised.
207. Of what avail to them will be their past en-
joyments?
208. Never did We destroy a town, but it had
warners.

how they say what they do not do?
