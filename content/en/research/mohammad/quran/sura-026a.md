{{< s v="10" >}}  Your Lord called to Moses, “Go to the tyrannical people.

{{< s v="11" >}}  The people of Pharaoh. Will they not fear?”

He said, “My Lord, I fear they will rejectme.

13. And I become stressed, and my tongue is not fluent, so send Aaron too.

14. And they have a charge against me, so I fear they will kill me.”

15. He said, “No. Go, both of you, with Our proofs. We will be with you, listening.

{{< s v="16" >}}Go to Pharaoh, and say, ‘We are the Messengers of the Lord of the Worlds.

31. He said, “Bring it, if you are being truthful.”

17. Let So he cast his staff; and it was a serpent, plain to see.

33. And he pulled his hand; and it was white, for all to see.

34. He said to the dignitaries around him, “This is a skilled magician.

35. He intends to drive you out of your land with his magic, so what do you recommend?”

36. They said, “Delay him and his brother, and send recruiters to the cities.


18. He 37. To bring the Jews go with us.'“
said, “Did we not raise you among us as a child, and you stayed among us for many of your years?

19. And you committed that deed you committed, and you were ungrateful.”
20. He said, “I did it then, when I was of those astray.
21. And I fled from you when I feared you; but my Lord gave me wisdom, and made me one of the messengers.
22. Is that the favor you taunt me with, although you have enslaved the Jews?”
23. Pharaoh said, “And what is the Lord of the Worlds?”
24. He said, “The Lord of the heavens and the earth, and everything between them, if you are aware.”
25. He said to those around him, “Do you not hear?”
26. He said, “Your Lord and the Lord of your ancestors of old.”
27. He said, “This messenger of yours, who is sent to you, is crazy.”
28. He said, “Lord of the East and the West, and everything between them, if you understand.”
29. He said, “If you accept any god other than me, I will make you a prisoner.”
30. He said, “What if I bring you something convincing?”

the magicians were gathered for the appointment on a specified day.

39. And it was said to the people, “Are you all gathered?
40. That we may follow the magicians, if they
are the winners.”
41. When the magicians arrived, they said to
Pharaoh, “Is there a reward for us, if we are
the winners?”
42. He said, “Yes, and you will be among those
favored.”
43. Moses said to them, “Present what you in-
tend to present.”
44. So they threw their ropes and their sticks,
and said, “By the majesty of Pharaoh, we will
be the winners.”
45. Then Moses threw his staff, and behold, it
began swallowing their trickery.
38. So

the magicians fell down prostrating.
They said, “We have believed in the Lord
of the Worlds.

He said, “Did you believe in Him before I have given you permission? He must be your
chief, who taught you magic. You will soon know. I will cut off your hands and feet on
opposite sides, and I will crucify you all.”

50. They said, “No problem. To our Lord we will return.


51. We are eager for our Lord to forgive us our sins, since we are the first of the believers.”
52. And We inspired Moses: “Travel with My servants by night. You will be followed.”

they pursued them at sunrise.
When the two groups sighted each other,
the followers of Moses said, “We are being
overtaken.”
62. He said, “No; my Lord is with me, He will
guide me.”
63. We inspired Moses: “Strike the sea with
your staff.” Whereupon it parted, and each
part was like a huge hill.

we have no intercessors.
101. And

102. If only we could have another chance, we

104. Your
Lord is the Almighty, the Merciful.
The people of Noah disbelieved the mes-
sengers.

They said, “Shall we believe in you, when
it is the lowliest who follow you?”
112. He said, “What do I know about what they

113. Their account rests only with my Lord, if
you have sense.

lievers.

said, “If you do not refrain, O Noah,
you will be stoned.”
117. He said, “My Lord, my people have denied

me.

I fear for you the punishment of an awe-

136. They said, “It is the same for us, whether
you lecture us, or do not lecture.
135.
137. This
is nothing but morals of the ancients.
138. And
we will not be punished.”
So they denied him, and We destroyed
them. Surely in this is a sign, but most of
them are not believers.
139.

153. They said, “You are surely one of the be-
witched.
154. You are nothing but a man like us. So
bring us a sign, if you are truthful.
155. He said, “This is a she-camel; she has her
turn of drinking, and you have your turn of
drinking—on a specified day.
156. And do not touch her with harm, lest the
punishment of a great day seizes you.”
157. But they slaughtered her, and became full
of remorse.
158. So the punishment overtook them. Surely
in this is a sign, but most of them are not be-
lievers.
151. And

people of Lot disbelieved the messen-
gers.
161. When their brother Lot said to them, “Do
you not fear?
162. I
am to you a faithful messenger.
163. So
fear Allah, and obey me.
I ask of you no payment for it. My pay-
ment is only from the Lord of the Worlds.
164.
165. Do
you approach the males of the world?
And forsake the wives your Lord created
for you? Indeed, you are intrusive people.”
167. They said, “Unless you refrain, O Lot, you
will be expelled.”
168. He said, “I certainly deplore your con-
duct.”
169. “My Lord, save me and my family from
what they do.”
170. So We saved him and his family, alto-
gether.
166.
Except for an old woman among those
who tarried.
We destroyed the others.
And We rained down on them a rain.
Dreadful is the rain of those forewarned.
174. Surely in this is a sign, but most of them
are not believers.
173.
175. Your
Lord is the Almighty, the Merciful.
The People of the Woods disbelieved the
messengers.
177. When Shuaib said to them, “Do you not
fear?
176.
178. I
am to you a trustworthy messenger.
179. So
fear Allah, and obey me.
I ask of you no payment for it. My pay-
ment is only from the Lord of the Worlds.
180.
181. Give
full measure, and do not cheat.
182. And
weigh with accurate scales.
And do not defraud people of their be-
longings, and do not work corruption in the
land.
184. And fear Him who created you and the
masses of old.”
185. They said, “You are one of those be-
witched.
186. And you are nothing but a man like us;
and we think that you are a liar.
187. So bring down on us pieces from the sky,
if you are truthful.”
188. He said, “My Lord is Well Aware of what
you do.”
189. But they denied him. So the punishment
of the day of gloom gripped them. It was the
punishment of a great day.
190. Surely in this is a sign, but most of them
are not believers.
183.
191. Your
Lord is the Almighty, the Merciful.
It is a revelation from the Lord of the
Worlds.

197. Is it not a sign for them that the scholars
of the Jews recognized it?
198. Had We revealed it to one of the foreign-
ers.
199. And he had recited it to them, they still
would not have believed in it.
200. Thus We make it pass through the hearts
of the guilty.
201. They will not believe in it until they wit-
ness the painful punishment.
202. It will come to them suddenly, while they
are unaware.
203. Then they will say, “Are we given any res-
pite?”

We let them enjoy

206. Then there comes to them what they were
