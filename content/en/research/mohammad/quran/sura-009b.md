{{< s v="45" >}} Only those who do not believe in Allah and the Last Day ask you for exemption.
- Their hearts are full of doubts.

{{< s v="46" >}} Had they wanted to mobilize, they would have made preparations for it. 
- But Allah disliked their participation, so he held them back, and it was said, “Stay behind with those who stay behind.”

{{< s v="47" >}} Had they mobilized with you, they would have added only to your difficulties, and they would have spread rumors in your midst, trying to sow discord among you. Some of you are avid listeners to them. 

48. They tried to cause conflict before, and they hatched plots against you, until the truth prevailed, and the command of Allah became evident—in spite of their dislike.

49. Among them is he who says, “Excuse me, and do not trouble me.” In fact, they sunk into trouble. 

50. If something good happens to you, it upsets them; and if a calamity befalls you, they say, “We took our precautions in advance,” and they depart, happy.

51. Say, “Nothing will happen to us except what Allah has ordained for us; He is our Protector.” In Allah let the faithful put their trust.

52. Say, “Are you expecting for us anything other than one of the two excellences? As for us: we are expecting that Allah will afflict you with a punishment from Himself, or at our hands. So wait, we are waiting with you.”

53. Say, “Whether you spend willingly or unwillingly, it will not be accepted from you. You are evil people.”

54. What prevents the acceptance of their contributions is nothing but the fact that they disbelieved in Allah and His Messenger, and 

55. Let neither their possessions nor their children impress you. Allah intends to torment them through them in this worldly life, and that their souls depart while they are disbelievers.

56. They swear by Allah that they are of you. 
But they are not of you. They are divisive people.

57. Were they to find a shelter, or a cave, or a hideout, they would go to it, rushing.

58. And among them are those who criticize you in regard to charities. If they are given some of it, they become pleased; but if they are not given any, they grow resentful.

59. If only they were content with what Allah and His Messenger have given them, and said, “Allah is sufficient for us; Allah will give us of His bounty, and so will His Messenger; to Allah we eagerly turn.”

60. Charities are for:
- the poor and the destitute
- those who administer them
- reconciling hearts
- freeing slaves
- those in debt and in the path of Allah
- the traveler in need—an obligation from Allah. 

61. And among them are those who insult the Prophet, and say, “He is all ears.” Say, “He listens for your own good. 

He believes in Allah, and trusts the believers, and is mercy for those of you who believe.” 

<!-- Those who insult the Messenger of Allah will have a painful penalty. -->

<!-- 62. They swear to you by Allah to please you. But it is more proper for them to please Allah and His Messenger, if they are believers.  -->

<!-- 63. Do they not know that whoever opposes Allah and His Messenger, will have the Fire of Hell, abiding in it forever? That is the supreme disgrace. -->

64. The hypocrites worry lest a chapter may be revealed about them, informing them of what
Those who believe in Allah and the Last Day do not ask you for exemption from striving with their possessions and their lives. Allah is fully aware of the righteous.




hey said, “Do is in their hearts. Say, “Go on mocking; Allah
will bring out what you fear.”

65. If you ask them, they will say, “We were just joking and playing.” Say, “Were you
making jokes about Allah, His revelations, and His Messenger?”

66. Do not apologize. You have disbelieved after your belief. If We pardon some of you, We
will punish others, because they are guilty. 

67. The hypocrite men and hypocrite women are of one another. They advocate evil, and
prohibit righteousness, and withhold their hands. They forgot Allah, so He forgot them.
The hypocrites are the sinners.

68. Allah has promised the hypocrite men and hypocrite women, and the disbelievers, the
Fire of Hell, abiding therein forever. It is their due. And Allah has cursed them. They will
have a lasting punishment.

69. Like those before you. They were more powerful than you, and had more wealth and
children. They enjoyed their share, and you enjoyed your share, as those before you en-
joyed their share. 

And you indulged, as they indulged. It is they whose works will fail in
this world and in the Hereafter. It is they who
are the losers.

70. Have they not heard the stories of those before them? The people of Noah, and Aad, and
Thamood; and the people of Abraham, and the inhabitants of Median, and the Over-
turned Cities? Their messengers came to them with the clear proofs. Allah never
wronged them, but they used to wrong their own selves.

71. The believing men and believing women are friends of one another. They advocate vir-
tue, forbid evil, perform the prayers, practice charity, and obey Allah and His Messenger.
These—Allah will have mercy on them. Allah is Noble and Wise.

72. Allah promises the believers, men and women, gardens beneath which rivers flow,
abiding therein forever, and fine homes in


the Gardens of Eden. But approval from Al-
lah is even greater. That is the supreme
achievement.

73. O Prophet! Strive against the disbelievers and the hypocrites, and be stern with them.

74. They swear by Allah that they said nothing;
but they did utter the word of blasphemy, and they renounced faith after their submission.
And they plotted what they could not attain.

They were resentful only because Allah and His Messenger have enriched them out of His
grace. If they repent, it would be best for them; but if they turn away, Allah will afflict
them with a painful punishment—in this life and in the Hereafter—and they will have on
earth no protector and no savior.

75. Among them are those who promised Allah: “If He gives us of His bounty, we will do-
nate and be among the upright.”

76. But when He has given them of His bounty, they became stingy with it, and turned away
in aversion.

77. So He penalized them with hypocrisy in their hearts, until the Day they face Him—be-
cause they broke their promise to Allah, and because they used to lie.

<!-- 78. Do they not know that Allah knows their
secrets and their conspiracies? And that Allah
is the Knower of the unseen? -->

79. Those who criticize the believers who give charity voluntarily, and ridicule those who
find nothing to give except their own efforts—Allah ridicules them. They will have a painful punishment.

80. Whether you ask forgiveness for them, or do not ask forgiveness for them—even if you
ask forgiveness for them 70 times, Allah will not forgive them. 

That is because they disbelieved in Allah and His Messenger. <!-- Allah does not guide the immoral people. -->

81. Those who stayed behind rejoiced at their staying behind the Messenger of Allah. And
they hated to strive with their wealth and their lives in Allah’s way.



not venture out in the heat.” Say, “The Fire of
Hell is much hotter, if they only understood.”

82. Let them laugh a little, and weep much; in recompense for what they used to earn.

83. If Allah brings you back to a party of them, and they ask your permission to go out, say,
“You will not go out with me, ever, nor will you ever fight an enemy with me. You were
content to sit back the first time, so sit back with those who stay behind.”

84. You are never to pray over anyone of them who dies, nor are you to stand at his grave-
side. They rejected Allah and His Messenger, and died while they were sinners.

85. Do not let their possessions and their children impress you. Allah desires to torment
them through them in this world, and their souls expire while they are disbelievers.

86. When a chapter is revealed, stating: “Believe in Allah and strive with His Messenger,”
the prominent among them ask you for exemption. They say, “Allow us to stay with
those who stay behind.”

87. They prefer to be with those who stay behind. Their hearts were sealed, so they do not
understand.

88. But the Messenger and those who believe with him struggle with their possessions and
their lives. These have deserved the good things. These are the successful.

89. Allah has prepared for them gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will
abide forever. That is the great victory.

90. Some of the Desert-Arabs came to make excuses, asking to be granted exemption, while those who were untrue to Allah and His Messenger stayed behind. 

91. There is no blame on the weak, nor on the sick, nor on those who have nothing to give,
provided they are true to Allah and His Messenger. <!-- In no way can the righteous be
blamed. -->

92. Nor on those who approach you, wishing to ride with you, and you said, “I have noth-
ing to carry you on.” So they went away, with their eyes overflowing with tears, sorrowing
for not finding the means to spend.

93. But blame is on those who ask you for exemption, although they are rich. They are content to be with those who stay behind. Allah has sealed their hearts, so they do not know.

94. They present excuses to you when you return to them. Say, “Do not offer excuses; we
do not trust you; Allah has informed us of you. And Allah will watch your actions, and
so will the Messenger; then you will be returned to the Knower of the Invisible and the
Visible, and He will inform you of what you used to do.”

95. They will swear to you by Allah, when you return to them, that you may leave them
alone. So leave them alone. They are a disgrace, and their destiny is Hell; a reward for what they used to earn.

96. They will swear to you that you may accept them. But even if you accept them, Allah does
not accept the wicked people.

97. The Desert-Arabs are the most steeped in disbelief and hypocrisy, and the most likely to
ignore the limits that Allah revealed to His Messenger. Allah is Knowing and Wise.

98. And among the Desert-Arabs are those who consider their contribution to be a fine. And they wait for a reversal of your fortunes.

Upon them will fall the cycle of misfortune. 

99. Yet among the Desert-Arabs are those who believe in Allah and the Last Day, and con-
sider their contribution to be a means towards Allah, and the prayers of the Messenger. 

Surely it will draw them closer, and Allah will admit them into His mercy.
