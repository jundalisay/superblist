Stagnation is a common phenomenon in large and developed countries. It is called a 'stationary' state by Adam Smith and usually happens when everyone has achieved their natural state of wealth:


{{< q a="Adam-Smith" >}}
In a country fully peopled.. the competition for employment would necessarily be so great as to reduce wages to the minimum needed to keep up the number of labourers. The population would not increase since the country is already populous.

In a country fully stocked with as much business and stock as possible, the competition would everywhere be so great. It would reduce the ordinary profit as low as possible.

But perhaps no country has ever reached this degree of opulence. China seems to have been long stationary. But its riches might still be much inferior to what it could have been with other laws and institutions.

## Prolonged Stagnation is Unnatural, Absolute Stagnation is Impossible

Smith gave examples of a stagnating and declining economy as well as the policies that caused them.

<!-- Country | State | Causes | Source
--- | --- | --- | ---
Ming China | Stagnation | Wasteful governments |
.  | . | Weak environmental protection | 
British India | Declining | Lobbying by vested interests |
.  | . | High taxes on wages | Book 5, Chap 2
.  | . | Oppressive Intellectual Property Laws | Book 5, Chap 2 -->

Country | State | Causes | Source
--- | --- | --- | ---
Ming China | Stagnation | Wasteful governments | Book 5, Chap 3
.  | . | Weak environmental protection | Book 4, Chap 7
British India | Declining | Lobbying by vested interests | Book 1, Chap 11
.  | . | Unregulated stock trading | Lectures, Chap 3
.  | . | High taxes on wages | Book 5, Chap 2
.  | . | Arbitrary minimum wages | Book 1, Chap 10
.  | . | Oppressive Intellectual Property Laws | Book 5, Chap 1


These wrong policies created an unnatural stagnation or decline, eventually leading to civil wars or revolutions. 
- In China, the cause was the imperial system
- In India, the cause was the British mercantile system

Smith suggest the policy-fixes for each:

Policy | Hoped-for Result
--- | --- 
Government Frugality | Prevention of budget deficits
Stronger environmental protection | A stronger environmental as base of the economy
Rules against Lobbying | Prevention of monopoly
Regulated stock trading | Prevent Stock Bubbles
Zero taxes on wages | This ensures the economy will run
Natural wages | This ensures the economy will run
Oppressive Intellectual Property Laws | This encourages new technology


 <!-- that was caused by wrong policies and institutions. -->

 <!-- . Thus, the prolonged Chinese stagnation, as well as the decline of India during British colonialization, was a product of .  -->

<!-- The solution to break out of stagnation was to break free from the restrictive laws imposed by the imperial system in China -->

<!-- - the mercantile colonial system in India  -->

Generally, the solution to the imperial system was a gradual relaxation of imperial laws in order to grant more representation to the citizens.

<!-- - discouragement of wasteful governments.  (Book 5, Chap 3)
- governments must be strong to  (Book 4, Chap 7): -->

The solution to the mercantile system was to regulate the merchants and their institutions such as the stock market, customs, and intellectual property.

In Supereconomics, absolute stagnation is impossible because the first 3 laws naturally create dynamism. It is usually the Third and Fourth Laws that hinder this natural dynamism as a result of the Negative Force.  



<!-- - a discouragement on lobbying by vested interests. This will  which prevents the circulation of goods and services (Book 1, Chap 11)
- a discouragement trading of securities by the general public. This will prevent stock bubbles or the loss of the people's saved-up revenue. IPOs are still allowed though, so that companies can have access to funds. (Lecures, Chap 3)
- zero income taxes on wages. . (Book 5, Chap 2)
- natural wages instead of a decreed nominal minimum wage. This also ensures a running, non-stagnating economy. (Book 1, Chap 10)
- limiting of Intellectual Property to a shorter period. This ensures that new things and technologies can be produced, limiting stagnation (Book 5, Chap 1) -->


<!-- Why stagnations occurs. 

money-only economies naturally stagnate and crash since the mind only knows the current spacetime. 

future spacetime are unknown so spening and investments isn't done or failof their purpose. 

wave flow without being hindered 100% by objects.   -->
