In the process of the evolution of a society, the thinking class emerges from the worker and warrior classes. This class excels in learning, medicine, organization, and administration, so essential for the maintenance of any society. 

In Socratic philosophy, the Thinker Class is the aristocrat class which is made up intellectuals and philosophers. 

Unlike the warrior class which can maintain hereditary power, the thinking class has to maintain power by organizing themselves into thinking organizations such as churches, universities, and think tanks.
