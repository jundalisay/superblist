In Supereconomics, capital is anything that creates value. This is different from finished product or service which represent the value itself and is called in consumer goods and services in Part 1. 

Modern Economics which defines capital as property, machines, money, and equipment that produces goods and services.  

However, Supereconomics is a bit different that it inclues the skill, personal attributes, relationships, name, reputation, and other non-physical objects as capital.

## Two Types of Capital

1. Fixed Capital 

This yields a revenue without changing masters or circulating any further. Examples are:
- land improvements 
- useful machines


2. Circulating Capital 

<!-- The returns of the fixed capital employed by land improvers are much slower than the returns of the circulating capital. -->

This is employed in raising, manufacturing, or buying goods and selling them again. A Circulating Capital yields no revenue to its employer while it remains with him.

A merchant's goods provide no revenue until he sells them for money.
- The money yields him little until it is exchanged for goods.
- His capital is continually going from him in one shape and returning to him in another.
- Only such successive exchanges can yield him any profit.
