The Worker Class is called the Shudras in Hinduism. In the Republc by Plato, this is called the Democrats.

These are people who live by manual work or service. In the beginning of a society, more people are manual workers. This is true whether for nations, tribes, organizations, or businesses. A startup company, for example, would need a lot of workers to get it up and running quickly amidst the competition from established rivals.
