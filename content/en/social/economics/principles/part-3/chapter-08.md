The Eagle in the layer of economics manifests as supply and demand ratios:

{{< img src="https://sorasystem.sirv.com/graphics/pspdD.png" alt="Supply and Demand Equation" >}}


The `G` manifests as the effectual demand or `d` of the people.

The layer limit {{< sub v="l" >}} manifests as their absolute demand or `D` (a concept that does not exist in Economics).

This `D` works in the same way as `c` works in `E = mc{{< s v="2" >}}`, where `c` acts as the speed limit of the physical universe.


Neoclassical Economics and the commercial system are unable to arrive at the real price of everything because they use money which actually wipes out information with every exchange.

- If you barter 1 bread with 1 potato, then the real price of bread is 1 bread : 1 potato
- If potato can be bartered for 2 lemons, then the real value of 1 bread is 2 lemons or 1 potato
- If tomorrow, 1 potato exchanges only for 1 lemon, then the real value of 1 bread is 1 potato or 1 lemon
  - This means that the price of bread only crashes for the lemon owners but not for the potato owners. 
  - If the ratio of 1 bread still exchanges for 1 potato, then the real value or economic `G` of bread is more linked to potatoes instead of lemons. 

This prevents our proposed system from crashing because [the ratio of values](/social/economics/principles/intro/chapter-04/) are maintained and not made absolute or constant as in the commercial system. 

We can restore these natural ratios by pulling down money from the supreme pedestal where it currently stands on, just as we by fixed Einstein's General Relativity by removing the constant speed of light `c`, and instead using the other qualities of the star or galaxy where it comes from.

So in order to know a bread's "supereconomic" `G` or real value, we need to know what that bread was exchanged with, and not its money price. This chain of exchanges can then be backpropagated in order to know its relativistic value to other goods or services. 

Once the relative value-motions of goods and services are known, then we can predict the demand for them and so arrange the supply ahead of time in order to address all the demand and achieve constant zero-inflation.

Economics, on the other hand, allows only money-purchases so that 1 bread is equal to 1 dollar, for example. But it has no idea of where that 1 dollar came from. 

Did it come from wages? Or from a sale of a tomato? Was it donated? 

If you use machine-learning to backpropagate all the transactions for bread, you will end up with a dollar price but still not know what that dollar price really represents since the data was never recorded.

The best that they can do is apply stochastic calculus to create "algorithmic trading" and "dynamic stochastic general equilibrium" which have both caused crashes. Economists have no choice but to concede and say that price movements are mysterious, blaming "herd behavior", just as physicists say that gravitation is mysterious, pointing to wormholes that magically defy Physics.

{{< img src="https://sorasystem.sirv.com/cards/receipt.jpeg" cap="Commercial receipts just give the money value and has no information where that money value came from. This is the same problem that leads to tax avoidance and evasion, which then leads to budget deficits, weak governments, and subsequent instability." >}}


Our model on the other hand, follows Smith and the Physiocrats, and uses [grain-based valuation](/social/economics/principles/part-4/chapter-07c) to predict price movements from the outside looking in, or the top-down approach. This helped us to correctly predict:
- The rise of bitcoin in 2017
- The global economic crisis starting in 2019. It actually started in Q1 2020 and this shows that a bottom-up approach would be more accurate 

This bottom-up approach is exactly what Francois Quesnay had in mind when he created [the Economic Table](/social/economics/solutions/modern-economic-table) to list the exchanges of commodities and trace their final total value or contribution to the economy. 

This system can be backpropagated in order to automate the process so that it can help visualize the map or neural network of the kinetic desire of human society. This then would allow demand to be predicted so that supply can be allocated ahead of time in order to prevent scarcity and the subsequent inequality and poverty that it creates.

The Modern Economic Table is a flowchart invented by Francois Quesnay of the Physiocrats in the 18th century. 

They say that it serves as data-driven proof of how real wealth is generated from agriculture and mining instead of from manufacturing and services which merely add value.

![Economic table](https://ik.imagekit.io/sora/charts/economictable_wNstQSmMc.jpg)

Of course, this is not totally true. It is true that raw materials and agriculture create value from scratch, as coming from Mother Nature. But the value added by manufacturing and services might just be as valuable, or even more valuable than the initial value created from Nature. In Supereconomics, we call it Value-adding Effort. 

An easy proof is Singapore which has zero agriculture and extractive industries, yet is very wealthy because of its commerce and manufacturing. This is also mostly true for Japan and South Korea. 

But since those countries would be nothing without those foreign imports, then we can say that the Physiocrats are correct in a broad, general sense.

## The Physiocrats vs Modern Economics

The Physiocrats' Economic Table advocates the mechanization of agriculture and extraction in order to maximize the raw material output which is the basis for further processing and manufacturing.

{{< q a="quesnay" >}}
We do not mean the small-scale cultivation carried on with oxen. This ungrateful cultivation reveals the poverty and ruin of the Nations where it prevails. It has nothing to do with the order of the Table.
{{< /q >}}


- While Economics supports the cause of merchants and money, the Physiocrats supported the cause of farmers and food. 
- While Economics advocates liberalism so that money can circulate freely, Physiocracy, along with Smith, advocates the regulation of money-arbitrage which we call **secondary arbitrage**.

<!-- By using, the social cycles of Socrates, we can classify the modern economists as part of the oligarch class, and the Physiocrats as the democrat class. Adam Smith would be the aristocratic class of philosophers, while Communism would be the tyranny class which started out as the democrat class.
 -->

{{< q a="quesnay" >}}
Maxim 7 Complete Circulation: Let the sum total of the revenues be annually returned into and along the entire course of circulation; let no money fortunes be accumulated
Maxim 10 Revenue Expended in the Country: Let none of the revenue pass into the home of the stranger without return either in money or merchandise.

Maxim 24 Balance of Money in Trade is Illusory: Let no one be deceived by an apparent advantage in reciprocal commerce with foreign countries, which is simply a balance received in money, without examining and comparing the profits that result from the merchandise one has sold and the merchandise which has been bought.

## Our Modern Economic Table is an Online Ledger

<!-- Leads to Real Prices and Fair (Non-commercial) Taxation -->

This regulation is done through the Economic Table which lists the chain of transactions that are involved in turning a raw material into a finished product which then manifests as wealth. The chain shows the increase in the market value and the natural price of a commodity as it is processed subsequently by [human effort](/social/economics/principles/part-2/chapter-01b/). 

We then implement this transaction system as a ledger of points-transactions.

![Table](/graphics/econ/table.jpg)


In this way, the ledger can show the **real price** of products, commodities, and services relative to grain. This will then relativistically reveal which companies and industries are generating the most wealth for the least expense. 

Modern Economics has no concept of real or natural price because it is grounded on money, which wipes out the relativity of real prices in order to create arbitrage and profit maximization. This then explains why economic systems are unstable and have systemic risk.

Supereconomics uses the ledger-based comparison of subjective market price (effect) to its objective natural price (cause) to achieve 2 goals:

1. A points-based taxation system which can check inflation and inequality at its root. 

When done online and with machine learning, this can lead to granular adjustments of tax rates for every kind of commodity. In this way, public revenue is increased without stifling economic activity. 

Taxation can also be used more quickly to respond to sudden events like natural disasters in order to drive donations and rebuild capital faster. It can also be used to stifle harmful activities like deforestation or pollution. 

This would make taxation much more convenient since it is imposed automatically. There would be no more need for filing income taxes because the tax due is computed automatically with each commercial transaction or barter exchange


2. A way to show in real-time which goods and products have overinvestments and which have underinvestments. 

This then would allow an Investment Fund to adjust its rate of return in order to pump up underinvestments and reduce overinvestment.

As you can see, Superphysics has a lot of tools to grow an economy while preventing monopoly, inequality, and poverty that is simply unthinkable in Economics. The next post will explain the last tool, which is the DCTI.
