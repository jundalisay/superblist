<!-- For the past few months, we have been testing the operations of our proposed points-based economic system.  -->


The following ratios determine the useful productivity of the users of our points-based system just as capitalism has ratios such as Earning per Share, ROI, Return on Assets, etc. 

## Realization Ratio

This is the ratio of the actual realized points versus the total points. 

```elixir
Realized Points / Total Net Points 
```

## Average Time to Realize  

This is the average time that it takes to realize a point from the time when that point was created or given. 

```elixir
AVE(Time of Point Debit - Time of Point Credit) 
```

## Transaction Usefulness Ratio  

This is the number of transaction instances that were realized, relative to the total number of transactions done. 


```elixir
Realized Transaction Instances / Total Number of Transactions Done 
```
