Our system, called Social Superphysics, follows the social cycles theory of Socrates which states that each society has a season of aristocracy, oligarchy, democracy, and tyranny, which is mirrored by the Hindu brahmin, vaesya, shudra, and ksattriya varnas. 

We simplify these as thinker, trader, worker, and warrior in order to predict events in society and answer questions.


**Question: Assuming that the candidates for Philippine President are: Sarah Duterte, Bongbong Marcos, Leni Robredo, Richard Gordon, and Grace Poe, who will win and what will the rankings be?**


Answer: Through a cursory look at the historical behavior of the candidates, we can classify each of them into the following types:

Candidate | Mentality
--- | ---
Sarah Duterte | Worker-Worker
Bongbong Marcos | Warrior-Worker
Richard Gordon | Intellectual-Merchant
Leni Robredo | Worker-Merchant
Grace Poe | Merchant-Worker

As the Philippines is currently in a worker cycle and will go into a warrior cycle in a few years, we predict that Sarah Duterte will become President, with possible rankings being:

1. Sarah Duterte
2. Bongbong Marcos
3. Leni Robredo
4. Grace Poe
5. Richard Gordon

> Disclaimer: The predictions here are based on opinion arising from modeling and publicly available information as of June 2021. These are meant to be general guidance and information. We will not be responsible for any gains, losses, and damages, arising from the consequences of assigning these as fact.


## Update: Decemer 2022

In reality, Bongbong Marcos won as President, and Sarah won as Vice President. 

Sarah got more votes as Vice President than Marcos as President, matching the prediction.
