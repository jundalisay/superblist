Ego-based virtues:

Desire for utility (cleanliness, production of trinkets and baubles)
Ambition
Courage
Magnanimity, etc


Sympathy-based virtues:

‘Amiable’ virtues which are common:

Gratitude
Sense of Justice, etc


‘Respectable’ virtues which are not so common:

Self-command
Generosity

The impartial spectator, which represents the moral sense in all humans, then regulates and balances the ego-based and sympathy-based virtues to produce happiness for all, even plants and animals. We can say that human dharma or the invisible hand of Jupiter properly regulates physical and animal nature.

Examples of moral systems that are founded on the ego-based virtues are utilitarianism, liberalism, and libertarianism. The corruption of morality usual starts from these. As proof, the corruption of Adam Smith's invisible hand into Samuelson's invisible hand was done by Paul Samuelson, a liberal. Sameulson’s textbook Economics enshrined ego and destroyed even the most basic kind of sympathy, such as the sympathy for poor children:


As you can see, generosity is in the bottom rung of sympathy-based virtues, together with self-command, while utility is on the top of ego-based virtues. This means that we observe more instances of people wanting useful things, than people wanting to give away useful things, because ego is currently dominant in our species. However, the lack of slavery nowadays, which was the norm in ancient times, shows that the ego-level is generally declining.


With this, we can answer the question:

Charitable giving, a human virtue, can never be more powerful than all the other human virtues combined
The Gates' Foundation cannot hope to do as much good for society as Microsoft within the next hundreds of years, since it took thousands of years just to raise sympathy-based virtues close to the level of ego-based ones. Generosity can only dominate if sympathy dominates and ego disappears. But ego can only disappear if everyone’s mind were merged into one entity, either spiritually or electronically like in the Matrix.
