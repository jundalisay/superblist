In Material Superphysics, we exposed the many errors of Physics to the supremacy of matter and the materialist mindset. 

These errors extend to sociology through 2 prevalent materialist philosophies:

1. Capitalism

This is based on money which was based on material gold and silver, which is used to force changes in economies through buying and selling. 

2. Communism

This is based on dialectical materialism where material strength is used to force changes in society.

These 2 philosophies fight each other:
- Capitalism uses material wealth to create the changes that wealthy people want to happen 
- Communism uses material force to create the changes that forceful people want to happen

These have caused a lot of conflict and suffering since matter is naturally crude, unthinking, and is therefore dominated by mere chance (which is decided by the immaterial aether). A simple proof is the conflict between the Capitalist West and ex-Communist Russia:
- The West imposed financial wealth sanctions to make Russia change its offensive actions
- Russia uses physical bombs and tanks to make Ukraine change into surrender
