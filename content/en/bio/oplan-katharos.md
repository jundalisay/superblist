The scourge of counterfeit medicines is prevelant around the world, both in rich and poor countries. The problem became worse during the pandemic when the demand for flu medicines increased significantly, especially through online channels. 

As an example, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the Philippines reveals that fake Paracetamol became rampant during the pandemic, with sari-sari stores (local convenience stores) selling the counterfeit items.

To address this danger to public health, the FDA launched Oplan Katharos on April 12, 2023.


## What is Oplan Katharos?

Oplan Katharos is a technical working group within the Philippine FDA. It aims to develop and implement guidelines in the proper handling, storage, and disposal of seized health products. The end goal is to protect public health from the dangers of fake medicines in line with Republic Act (RA) 3720. 

The FDA acknowledges that the fight against counterfeit medicines is a 'silent war'. They revealed that 1 out of 10 medicines are counterfeit. 

According to the Philippines' Intellectual Property Office, Php 23.9 billion of counterfeit items, including food, medicine, and apparel, have been seized from January to September 2023.

To address this, they are training local law enforcement to detect and prosecute the makers, peddlers, possessors, and establishments that serve such medicines. Congress is willing to allocate up to Php 3 billion to beef up their anti-counterfeit campaign.  

Along with this plan is a campaign to educate the people to:

- buy registered health products and medicines from establishments with the license to operate 
- avoid buying medicines and health products from sari sari stores, peddlers, and unlicensed establishments
- inform local authorities such as the FDA and the Intellectual Property Office of counterfeit items 
  - For example, people can contact IPOPHIL regarding counterfeit items:
    - Send a message via Messenger to https://www.facebook.com/IPOPHLIEO/
    - Send an email to operations@ipophil.gov.ph
