Einstein admitted that his whole theory was a scam from the start, as circular reasoning. 

"Your definition would be right, if the light by means of which the observer at M perceives the lightning flashes travels along the length A -> M with the same velocity as along the length B -> M. But an examination of this supposition would only be possible if we already had at our disposal the means of measuring time. It would thus appear as though we were moving here in a logical circle. (On the Idea of Time)"

There is no need to rack your brain trying to disprove or expose a scam. 

There is no need to cite Veritasium either.

We have solved it by using Cartesian (Descartes') Physics which has Lorentz-Poincare Relativity instead of Einstein's scam Relativity.

The core of the problem is that Einstein used light (electromagnetism) to measure spacetime. The great big problem is that electromagnetism is INFERIOR to spacetime. So using light to measure space is to lock space and make it fixed and rigid. You will notice that they use atomic clocks to test Relativity and it always passes the test. 

This is like asking Trump supporters to judge Trump. Of course, they will always give Trump the highest marks. 

Einstein's Relativity is destroyed by using either material time or mental time. This is like asking a Democrat to judge Trump.

For example, use a sand clock in a fast airplane to measure material time relative to a stationary sand clock at the airport. 

Or have a person sleep in the fast airplane and wake him up upon touchdown and ask him how many hours he thinks he slept. Do it also for a guy sleeping in the airport.

How Artificial Intelligence Can Prevent Banking Crisis

Last week, Vietnam was rocked by the scandal between Saigon Commercial Bank (SCB) and property developer Van Thinh Phat group (VTP) wherein SCB lent $44 billion of its deposits to the group through Truong My Lan who gained ownership of SCB through dummies.

She bribed Central Bank officials to allow her illegal ploy. 

Banking crises and scandals are not new. Back in the 18th century, many banks collapsed due to speculation and imprudent practices. Adam Smith said that one of the best preventatives for such crises was to create strict rules. These rules are usually implemented by the government through the Central Bank.

The problem is that the Central Bank itself is made up of humans which are corruptible, as proven by the SCB scandal. 

To solve this, it would be better to implement the rules through artificial intelligence
